**When the iPhone Becomes My Shepherd: Learning Limits in a World of AI**

I’ve spent the last few years shepherding a small church that sits uncomfortably close to the heart of Silicon Valley. The Wi‑Fi is fast, the coffee is artisanal, and the conversations at the kitchen table often drift into the language of algorithms, data pipelines, and—more recently—artificial intelligence. It’s tempting to think of AI as just another tool, like a spreadsheet or a video‑editing app, something we can pick up, use, and set aside. The reality, however, is far messier.

A few weeks ago I found myself staring at my iPhone in the middle of a Sunday service. A notification pinged—an article about a new AI‑generated “friend” that could chat with you 24/7. I slipped it into my pocket, feeling that familiar tug: “I could use a quick distraction after the sermon.” The temptation was there, not because I needed the app, but because the device itself seemed to be whispering, “I’m here for you. I’ll fill the silence.”

That moment reminded me of something my grandmother used to say: “When the kettle whistles, it’s not the kettle that needs you—it’s the water waiting to be boiled.” The iPhone, the AI, the endless scroll—these are not neutral vessels. They are designed to capture attention, to smooth over the uncomfortable edges of our finite lives. Tristan Harris and Sherry Turkle have been sounding this alarm for years, but hearing it in the quiet of a sanctuary makes it hit harder.

I’ve started a small practice for myself: every three months I pull the plug on my phone for a full day. No email, no social feed, no AI chat. I take a notebook, a pen, and a walk through the neighborhood. I call a friend instead of texting. It feels like stepping back into a world where my thoughts are not filtered through a recommendation engine. The first few hours are uneasy, like a muscle that’s been unused for too long. But then something happens—I become aware of the rhythm of my own breath, the texture of the sky, the way my neighbor’s laugh carries across the street. Those are the moments God scattered through the day for us to notice.

The temptation to let technology fill the gaps in our humanity is real, and it’s not a sin to feel drawn to it. The danger lies in letting those gaps become permanent, in allowing a digital companion to replace the messy, beautiful, and sometimes painful intimacy of real human relationships. The AI “girlfriend” you can subscribe to may never argue with you, never forget a birthday, never leave you feeling alone—but it also never loves you, never bears your burdens, never points you back to the One who made you in his image.

So I ask you, wherever you are sitting today—behind a pulpit, at a kitchen table, in a coffee shop—what is the “iPhone” in your life that’s trying to shepherd you? How often do you pause, set a boundary, and simply be? The limits God placed on us are not cages; they’re the very space in which we discover our dependence on Him and on each other.

*Take a moment this week to turn off a device for an hour. Notice what you miss and what you gain. In the quiet, listen for the still, small voice that reminds you who you were created to be.*

**Digital Girlfriends and the Dehumanizing Trap: A Pastor’s Warning**

There’s a new service on the market that sounds like something out of a sci‑fi romance novel: for a modest monthly fee, you can “subscribe” to an AI‑generated boyfriend or girlfriend. You get a curated feed of images, a chatbot that mirrors the personality of a real person, and the illusion of companionship without the mess of real life. I read about it while scrolling through my feed on a Tuesday evening, and a knot formed in my stomach.

I’m not a technophobe. I’ve watched AI write sermons, translate languages, and even suggest hymns for worship. The problem isn’t the technology itself; it’s the way it’s being weaponized against the very thing that makes us human—our embodied, relational, fallible selves. When a digital avatar can answer your midnight anxieties without ever getting tired, when it can be programmed to say exactly what you want to hear, we start to trade the messy, beautiful truth of human connection for a sanitized simulation.

I remember a conversation I had with a young adult in my congregation a few months ago. She confessed she’d been spending hours each night chatting with an AI “friend” that never judged her, never left her on read. She said it felt “safe,” but also that she felt an odd emptiness when the conversation ended. I asked her, “Who do you turn to when you need prayer?” She paused, then said, “I guess I don’t know.” In that moment, the digital relationship had become a substitute for the very thing we’re called to do as the body of Christ—carry each other’s burdens (Gal 4:2).

The danger isn’t just personal; it’s communal. If we allow AI to become the default “friend,” we erode the fabric of fellowship that the church has been weaving for centuries. The Apostle Paul warned the Thessalonians that the “love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” In our context, the love of convenience—of a relationship that never requires us to be vulnerable—can become a similar root.

That’s not to say we should reject every piece of technology. The same AI that can generate a digital companion can also translate a sermon into a language a refugee in our community can understand, or help a pastor with a disability prepare a worship set. The key is discernment: Are we using the tool to amplify God’s love, or are we letting the tool dictate the shape of our love?

I’ve started a small group in my church called “Real Talk, Real People,” where we meet weekly to share stories of loneliness, to pray for one another, and to remind each other that we’re made for embodied community. We’ve even set up a “phone‑free” hour during our gatherings, encouraging everyone to put the devices down and just listen. It feels strange at first, like stepping onto a dance floor without music, but the rhythm soon returns—our own, imperfect, human rhythm.

*Consider this: If you could replace a real conversation with an AI chat, would you? What would that say about the value you place on your fellow human? Take a step this week to reach out to someone in person, even if it feels awkward. Let the conversation be messy, let it be real, and let it point you back to the One who designed you for relationship.*

**Beyond Ones and Zeroes: Why Only God Can Give Us an Eternal Soul**

If you strip away the glossy interfaces, the endless notifications, and the sleek hardware, what is AI at its core? It’s a tapestry of ones and zeroes, electrical currents humming through silicon, patterns that mimic human language but lack the breath of life. I often sit in my office, laptop open, watching a generative model spin out a poem about sunrise. The words are beautiful, but they lack the weight of a soul’s sigh.

A few months ago I was invited to a tech conference in Palo Alto. Between the keynote speeches about quantum computing and panels on AI ethics, a young engineer approached me, eyes bright with excitement. “We’re close to creating an AI that can feel,” she whispered, as if sharing a secret. I smiled, but inside I heard the echo of C.S. Lewis’s line: “You have never met a mere mortal imago Dei.” The engineer’s enthusiasm was genuine, yet I sensed a subtle hubris—a belief that the spark of humanity could be replicated in code.

The truth is, no amount of data, no matter how vast, can manufacture an eternal soul. That is God’s exclusive domain. He breathes life into dust (Genesis 2:7) and fashions each of us in his image (Genesis 1:27). The AI I work with can simulate empathy, but it cannot experience the deep ache of longing for the divine, nor can it stand before the judgment seat with a heart that knows sin.

This distinction matters for us as Christian leaders because it grounds our approach to technology. When we recognize that AI is a tool, not a partner, we can use it without fearing that it will replace the very essence of what we are called to be. We can harness AI to translate Scripture, to map out missionary routes, to help a student with a disability access worship. But we must also guard against the subtle creep that suggests we can outsource the work of the Spirit to an algorithm.

I’ve begun to weave this theology into my teaching. In one recent Bible study, we explored the story of the Tower of Babel. Humanity’s ambition to build a tower that reaches the heavens was thwarted not because of a lack of engineering skill, but because God scattered languages to remind us of our dependence on Him. In a similar way, AI can be a tower we build—impressive, awe‑inspiring—but we must ensure it doesn’t become an idolatrous monument that distracts us from the One who truly knows us.

One practical step I’ve taken is to incorporate “soul‑checks” into my ministry team’s tech meetings. Before we adopt a new AI tool, we ask: “Does this deepen our relational ministry, or does it merely automate it?” “Will this help us point people to the living God, or does it risk making us complacent?” These questions keep the focus on the eternal rather than the temporary.

The world will continue to marvel at the wonders of machine learning, and the pressure to keep up will be relentless. Yet the paradox of Christian faith is that our greatest strength lies not in what we can create, but in what God has already given us—a soul that longs, loves, and ultimately belongs to Him.

*Spend a quiet moment this week reflecting on the unique imprint of your soul. Ask God to show you where you might be letting a tool replace a relationship, and pray for the wisdom to keep the divine spark alive in every interaction, whether mediated by silicon or by flesh.*
