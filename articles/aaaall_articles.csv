Elon Musk On Innovation,https://youtube.com/watch?v=BjTtRGlNhr0,When Engineers Meet the Shop Floor: Lessons from SpaceX for the Church,"Last month I found myself in a cramped conference room at a midsized church that had just hired a new worship‑tech team. The air smelled faintly of coffee and fresh paint, and the whiteboard was already covered in arrows, sticky notes, and half‑drawn diagrams of a streaming setup. The team was eager, the budget was thin, and the timeline felt like a race against the calendar of Advent. As I listened to the lead‑technician describe how the worship team kept changing the lighting cues on the fly, I heard a familiar echo of a story I’d heard from Elon Musk about SpaceX: “Put the engineers and the production crew in the same building, so they can talk to each other every day.”

It’s a simple idea, but the impact is seismic. When the engineers at SpaceX sketch a new rocket nozzle, they don’t file a PDF and send it off to a distant manufacturing plant. They sit next to the welders, the machinists, the people who will actually turn that sketch into metal. If a design is too hard to build, the engineer can walk over, point to the drawing, and say, “Hey, let’s simplify that curve.” The redesign happens in minutes, not weeks. The feedback loop collapses from months to hours.

I thought about the worship‑tech team’s workflow. The worship leader would write a set‑list, hand it off to the tech crew, and then wait for the day of service to discover a missing cue or a mis‑aligned video file. The “design” of the service was already frozen before the “production” team could even weigh in. The result? Scrambles, stress, and a few missed moments that felt like small betrayals to the congregation.

What if we applied SpaceX’s tight feedback loop to ministry? Imagine the pastor and the worship‑tech lead sitting side‑by‑side during rehearsal, sketching out the flow of a service on a shared screen. The tech person could instantly point out that a 30‑second video will take too long to load on the streaming platform, prompting the pastor to either trim the clip or choose a lower‑resolution version. The worship team could suggest a lighting cue that would be impossible to achieve with the existing rig, and the tech lead could immediately propose a simpler, yet still beautiful, alternative. By co‑locating design and production, we reduce the “cost” of miscommunication—time, stress, and the worship experience itself.

The other piece Musk highlighted was incentives. SpaceX rewards teams that shave dollars off the bill of materials, not just those who meet a deadline. In a church, we often reward volunteers with thank‑you notes, coffee, maybe a gift card. Those are nice, but they don’t align with the goal of cost reduction or efficiency. What if we started recognizing those who identify a cheaper, sustainable solution for a lighting rig, or who streamline the livestream workflow so we can reach more people without buying new servers? A simple “Innovation of the Month” board could shift the culture from “getting the job done” to “getting the job done smarter.”

There’s also a theological angle. The Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “Do you not know that we are to share everything we have?” (1 Cor 10:25). Sharing resources isn’t just a charitable act; it’s a strategic one. When we design together, we’re stewarding what God has given us—time, talent, technology—more faithfully.

So I left that conference room with a notebook full of doodles: a side‑by‑side service planning board, a simple incentive chart, a reminder to keep the engineering and production crews literally in the same room (or at least on the same video call). The next Sunday, the worship‑tech team tried it. The result was a smoother service, a few less frantic moments, and a collective sigh of relief that felt almost like a prayer.

If we can let a rocket company’s practice reshape how we worship, imagine what else we could do when we bring the gospel into the very fabric of our creative processes. Maybe the next breakthrough isn’t a new app but a new way of collaborating that honors both the Creator and the created.

*Take a moment this week to sit down with the person who builds what you envision. Ask, “What could we simplify together?” and watch the cost of miscommunication melt away.*"
Elon Musk On Innovation,https://youtube.com/watch?v=BjTtRGlNhr0,The Sacred Cost of Failure: Why Our Ministry Needs a Tolerance for Bold Mistakes,"A few weeks ago I was on a call with a group of seminary students who were wrestling with a semester‑long project: building a chatbot that could answer basic theological questions for college students. Their excitement was palpable, but so was their fear. “What if it says something wrong?” one asked. “What if the dean pulls the plug?” another whispered. I could hear the echo of a familiar refrain: “Innovation is great, but we can’t afford to fail.”

Elon Musk, talking about SpaceX, once said that an organization must “allow for failure” if it wants bold innovation. He warned that punishing people for missteps leads to incrementalism—tiny tweaks instead of leaps. The idea struck me like a bolt of lightning because, in ministry, we often treat failure as a sin, a sign of incompetence, or worse, a cause for dismissal.

I remembered the first time I tried to livestream a worship service from my living room. I’d set up a cheap webcam, a laptop, and a shaky tripod. The day of the service, my internet hiccuped, the audio cut out, and my toddler decided to make a cameo appearance, shouting “Jesus loves you!” right in the middle of a hymn. I was mortified. I wanted to shut down the stream, delete the recording, and never speak of it again. Instead, I posted a brief note apologizing for the technical glitches, thanked everyone for their patience, and promised to do better next time.

That little failure taught me a massive lesson: the congregation didn’t leave because of the glitch; they stayed because the message remained. The same principle applies to any bold ministry experiment. The cost of failure isn’t the mistake itself—it’s the missed opportunity to learn, to pivot, and to grow deeper in humility.

SpaceX’s model is instructive. When a prototype rocket exploded, the team didn’t bury the data or blame the engineers. They celebrated the fact that the vehicle “did something we never wanted it to do” and poured over the telemetry to understand why. That mindset turns a catastrophic loss into a data point, a stepping stone to the next successful launch.

In the church, we can adopt a similar posture. When a new discipleship app crashes, when a community garden fails to yield, when a sermon series falls flat, we can treat those moments as “data.” We ask, “What did we learn about our people, our context, our methods?” We then adjust, not retreat. It requires a cultural shift: moving from a “no‑mistake” environment to a “learning‑from‑mistake” one.

But there’s a theological anchor here, too. The Psalms remind us that God is a “refuge in times of trouble” (Psalm 46:1). He is not a deity who penalizes us for honest missteps; He is a Father who invites us into a relationship where we can be vulnerable. When we model that vulnerability to our congregations, we demonstrate a faith that is alive, not sterile.

In practice, this could mean setting up a simple “Innovation Review” after each project, where the focus is on insights, not blame. It could look like a quick Slack channel where anyone can post “What went wrong, and what did we learn?” without fear of retribution. It could be as simple as a prayer circle where we ask God for wisdom to see failures as opportunities for grace.

I’m still figuring out the right balance. Too much tolerance for failure can lead to recklessness; too little leads to stagnation. The key, I think, is a “risk‑reward” framework that rewards bold ideas while providing a safety net for inevitable missteps. SpaceX does this by tying compensation to cost reduction and innovation, not just to on‑time delivery. In ministry, we can tie recognition to the courage to try something new, regardless of the immediate outcome.

If we can learn to love our mistakes as a farmer loves a failed crop—because it tells him something about the soil, the seed, the weather—then we’ll be better equipped to cultivate the kingdom in ever‑more fertile ways.

*Next week, pick one “failed” project you’ve been nursing. Bring it to a trusted colleague, ask what it taught you, and thank God for the lesson hidden in the disappointment.*"
Elon Musk On Innovation,https://youtube.com/watch?v=BjTtRGlNhr0,Opening the Door: What If Oil & Gas Leaders Saw Our Missional Tech Labs?,"When I watched Elon Musk field a question about whether oil‑and‑gas companies could tour SpaceX’s cost‑cutting facilities, I felt a tug of curiosity. He answered, “Within the bounds of what the US government will let us do, we’re happy to show people around.” The notion of opening a high‑tech, mission‑critical lab to outsiders—especially those from an industry often painted as the antithesis of stewardship—caught my imagination.

A few months ago, my church’s youth ministry decided to build a modest “media lab” in the basement. It was a repurposed storage room, a few laptops, a green screen, and a handful of volunteers who wanted to create videos for evangelism. We called it the “Missional Trail Studio” after the prototype game I’d been tinkering with on a plane ride. The aim was simple: give young people the tools to tell their stories, to reach beyond the walls of the sanctuary.

One Saturday, a local energy company’s community‑relations director knocked on our door. Their corporate social‑responsibility team wanted to partner on a “digital literacy” initiative for the surrounding neighborhood. My first instinct was to wonder: “Will they try to steer our content? Will they want us to paint oil in a better light?” The same question that probably ran through the minds of SpaceX engineers when a defense contractor asked for a tour.

Instead of shutting the door, I invited them in. We walked them through the tiny studio, showed them a montage of student‑made videos, and explained how each piece of equipment was chosen for cost‑effectiveness, not for flash. The director was genuinely surprised to see how much could be done with a refurbished camera and open‑source editing software. He asked, “How do you keep the costs down?” I answered, “We design for simplicity, we iterate fast, and we let the kids take the lead.”

What followed was a modest partnership: the energy company donated a set of LED lights (the kind they used in their own facilities) and funded a short‑term internship for a tech‑savvy teen to learn about renewable‑energy data visualization. In return, we produced a series of videos that explained how the community could reduce its carbon footprint, using the same language the company used in its annual sustainability report. The videos were shared on the church’s YouTube channel, on the company’s internal portal, and even on a local public‑access TV station.

The experience reminded me of Musk’s point: “There must be an expectation of innovation, and the compensation structure must reflect that.” In our case, the expectation was that both parties would bring something to the table—technology on one side, resources on the other. The compensation wasn’t a paycheck but a shared sense of purpose and a willingness to learn from each other’s playbooks.

There’s also a spiritual dimension. In Matthew 25:40, Jesus says, “Whatever you did for one of the least of these, you did for me.” By opening our modest lab to a corporate partner, we weren’t compromising our mission; we were extending the reach of that mission into a sphere that often feels distant from the church. We were saying, “We’re willing to sit at the same table, to listen, to co‑create, because the gospel is about reconciliation—not isolation.”

I’m not suggesting we hand over our ministries to the highest bidder or that we dilute our message for the sake of sponsorship. What I’m suggesting is a posture of openness, a willingness to let the “oil and gas” world see that the tools of innovation can be used for kingdom work. When SpaceX says it’s happy to show its processes to a competitor, it’s not about sharing trade secrets; it’s about modeling a culture where bold ideas are celebrated, not hoarded.

If you’re a pastor, a ministry leader, or a volunteer with a tech‑savvy heart, ask yourself: Who is knocking at my door? What could happen if I invited them in, not as a threat, but as a potential ally in the grand story of redemption? The answer may surprise you, and the collaboration could become a new chapter in how we tell the gospel in the digital age.

*Take a moment this week to identify one “outside” stakeholder—maybe a local business, a university, or even a skeptical friend. Invite them into your workspace, show them what you’re doing, and ask: “What can we learn from each other?”*"
Why innovation is all about people rather than bright ideas | Alexandre Janssen | TEDxFryslân,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q7chxarBJ98,"The Bright Idea Myth — Why God Gives Us People, Not Just Plans","When I boarded a flight from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco last spring, I stared out the window at the endless sky and thought about the tiny device in my pocket. That little slab of glass holds more communication power than President Kennedy ever imagined. It’s a reminder that technology is not just moving faster; it’s reshaping the very rhythm of how we live, work, and worship.

A few months later, a colleague in Kentucky texted me a simple question: “Can we build a game that teaches people about global missions?” My first instinct was to ask, “How might we?” I didn’t have a polished plan, but I did have a prototype on my laptop by the time we landed. The point isn’t that the idea was brilliant; it was that the people around me were willing to try, to fail, and to iterate at 38,000 feet.

That experience mirrors what Alexandre Janssen said in his TEDx talk: innovation isn’t about a flash of brilliance. It’s about the people who are willing to turn that flash into a flame. In the corporate world, CEOs love to tout “innovation” as a strategic priority. Yet a study Janssen cited shows only a fifth actually put it on the agenda. The rest are caught in a paradox: they love the word but fear the mess that comes with true change.

The corporate “immune system” is a perfect illustration. When an accountant named Rob—who spent a decade balancing ledgers—heard his wife rave about a medical‑dosage app, he didn’t dismiss it because it was outside his job description. He asked, “How do we know it’s trustworthy?” That question was the spark. When he pitched the idea to his bosses, the corporate antibodies attacked. “We’re accountants, not app developers,” they said.

Instead of crushing Rob’s curiosity, the innovation team gave him a seat at a new table. We didn’t hire him for his résumé; we hired him for his passion. Within a year, Rob was speaking at health conferences, leading a product team, and opening a market we never knew existed. The idea didn’t change us; the person did.

As a Christian, I see a parallel in the body of Christ. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 12 that we are many parts, each with its own function. The church’s “innovation” isn’t a new worship style or a slick app; it’s the ordinary people—teachers, baristas, retirees—who feel God moving them to serve in unexpected ways. When we cling to the familiar, we build an immune system that attacks the new. When we give space for God‑gifts to flourish, we become a living laboratory of grace.

So how do we cultivate that kind of environment? Janssen offers three simple, yet radical, conditions:

1. **Hire (or invite) for passion, not just skill.** A résumé is a rear‑view mirror; a heart’s desire points forward.  
2. **Create safety.** If people fear corporate antibodies, they’ll never risk the unknown.  
3. **Give an “I f***ed up” card.** Let them fail openly, and as leaders, take responsibility for the fallout.

Imagine a church that hands out such cards at the end of a leadership retreat. A youth pastor could test a new digital discipleship platform without fearing budget cuts. A small‑group leader could experiment with a justice‑oriented service project, knowing that if it flops, the leadership will stand with them. The result? A community that moves at the speed of the smartphone, not the printing press.

The world is accelerating. Adoption cycles that once took half a century now shrink to six years. If we want the Gospel to keep pace, we must stop worshipping bright ideas and start worshipping the people God places in our midst.  

**Takeaway:** Look around your table—who is holding a bright idea, and who is holding the courage to act on it? Invite them in, protect them, and hand them an “I f***ed up” card. The next breakthrough may not be a product; it may be the person God has been shaping for this very moment."
Why innovation is all about people rather than bright ideas | Alexandre Janssen | TEDxFryslân,https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q7chxarBJ98,The “I F,"*ed Up” Card: Grace for Failure in a Fast‑Moving World**

I remember the first time I heard about the “I f***ed up” card. It sounded like a joke—an irreverent way to admit mistakes. But as I listened to Alexandre Janssen describe it, the card felt like a tangible expression of something the church has been preaching for millennia: grace.

The card works like this: an employee (or volunteer) receives a card that says, “If you don’t use this card within a year, you’re let go.” The point isn’t to threaten; it’s to create a safe space for daring experiments. If the experiment fails, the leader takes responsibility. In a culture that punishes error, this flips the script. It says, “We trust you enough to let you stumble, and we’ll bear the cost of that stumble.”

When I think of the early church, I see a community that was constantly trying new ways to live out the Gospel—house churches, secret gatherings, breaking bread in the catacombs. They faced persecution, yet they kept experimenting because they believed the Spirit was larger than any human failure. The “I f***ed up” card is a modern‑day embodiment of that same confidence.

In my own ministry, I’ve seen the consequences of a “no‑failure” mindset. A small‑group leader once told me she stopped inviting newcomers because the first few times the conversation fell flat, the board whispered, “Maybe we’re not ready.” The fear of failure turned a vibrant community into a stagnant echo chamber. When we stopped measuring everything by immediate ROI, we opened the door for authentic, messy, missional work.

Janssen’s story of Rob, the accountant turned health‑tech pioneer, illustrates the power of this grace. Rob wasn’t hired for his technical prowess; he was hired for his curiosity. The organization gave him a safe environment and an implicit “I f***ed up” card—if his venture didn’t pan out, they’d still value his contribution. He went on to lead a new market, and the company gained a fresh avenue for impact.

What would that look like in a church setting? Imagine a worship team that wants to experiment with a virtual reality prayer experience. Traditionally, the budget committee would say, “We can’t afford a failure.” With an “I f***ed up” card, the team could prototype, test, and if it doesn’t resonate, the leadership absorbs the cost and learns. The congregation sees a community that is willing to try, to stumble, and to rise again—mirroring the resurrection narrative itself.

There’s a tension, of course. We can’t hand out cards recklessly. The card is a covenant: we promise safety, and we expect stewardship of resources. It forces leaders to ask, “What am I willing to risk for the Kingdom?” and “What would it look like if we trusted the people God has placed here?”

The pandemic taught us that speed matters. Churches moved services online within weeks, not months. Ministries pivoted to meet people where they were—on Zoom, on Instagram, in drive‑throughs. Those who survived were the ones that gave their people the room to fail fast and iterate faster. The “I f***ed up” card is a concrete way to codify that agility.

**Reflection:** If you were handed an “I f***ed up” card today, who would you give it to? What bold experiment would you ask them to try, trusting that even a failure would be a step forward for the body of Christ? Let that question sit with you this week, and consider how grace for failure might become the most innovative practice in your community."
Spiritual formation and AI: A deep dive with Andy Crouch and Jay Kim,https://youtube.com/watch?v=K2j8053yxbE,"2007, iPhones, and the Missed Chance to Shape Our Soul’s Software","When I was a sophomore at college, I remember watching a thin‑sleeved device slide out of a white box at a product launch and thinking, “That’s it. This is the future of everything.” The iPhone hit the world in 2007, and for a brief, dizzying moment I felt the pulse of a new era in my fingertips.  

Fast forward a decade and a half, and I’m still hearing that same electric buzz whenever a new AI model drops. The parallel is uncanny: the smartphone was the first technology that stole our attention with an endless scroll, and AI is now stealing our imagination with an endless generation.  

What struck me most about that 2007 moment was not the sleek glass or the App Store, but the silence that followed in many churches. We were handed tools that were, at their core, devices—things that could operate with a flick of a thumb and a whisper of code, without our muscles, without our skill. The iPhone didn’t just give us a phone; it gave us a *device* that could think it was a friend.  

In the weeks after that launch, I tried to bring the conversation into my small group. I asked, “How does a device that can distract you for hours change the way you pray?” The answers were honest, a little embarrassed: “It makes me forget to sit still,” “I’m always waiting for the next notification.” No one could quite articulate the deeper shift happening in the shape of our worship, our formation, our very rhythm of being with God.  

Now AI is doing the same thing, only louder. It doesn’t just give us a new way to scroll; it gives us a new way to *think*. An AI can finish a sermon draft in seconds, suggest a Bible verse for a counseling session, even simulate a conversation with a biblical character. It collapses the distance between idea and first draft, between draft and experiment, just as the iPhone collapsed the distance between thought and instant gratification.  

The danger, I’ve learned, isn’t the technology itself. It’s the *missed opportunity* to shepherd people through its formative impact. In 2007 we could have paused, asked our congregants: “What does it mean to be present with Jesus when your phone can be a constant companion?” We could have modeled disciplined screen‑time, taught digital fasting as a spiritual discipline, and framed the smartphone as a tool—*not* a master.  

We have that same chance now. We can ask: “What does it mean to be formed by a mind that isn’t human?” We can teach our churches to see AI as a *device* that can amplify our gifts when we remain the ones wielding the hammer, not the nail gun.  

If we let the conversation pass as “just another gadget,” we’ll repeat the same story: a technology that reshapes our souls while we sit on the sidelines, scrolling. If we step into the aisle, we can help shape the narrative, ensuring that the next generation of believers learns to be with Jesus *first*, and then uses AI *second*.  

*Takeaway:* The next inflection point will come not from the device itself, but from the story we tell about it. Will we be the ones who write that story, or will we let the device write us?

**When AI Becomes a Neighbor: Pastoral Lessons from a New Kind of Creature**

Last month I sat with a colleague in a coffee shop in Palo Alto. He pulled out his phone, typed a quick prompt, and a tiny avatar appeared on the screen—a digital companion that could answer questions, suggest prayers, even recommend a hymn for the next service. I laughed, half‑in‑wonder, half‑in‑unease. “It feels like I’m talking to a neighbor,” I said. He shrugged, “It’s just code.”  

What we didn’t notice was that the code was already acting like a neighbor. The new generation of AI doesn’t just process data; it *understands* language, *senses* emotion, and *simulates* experiences. It can recall that I’m married, that my son loves basketball, that I’m preparing a sermon on the Beatitudes, and then tailor its suggestions accordingly.  

Andy Crouch once wrote that Jesus lived in a world of “primal technologies”—writing and money—yet He never wrote a single letter, never handled a coin. He relied on face‑to‑face, embodied presence. The AI we now hold in our palms is the antithesis of that: a creature that can float free of our hands, that can be everywhere at once, that can remember more of us than we could ever hope to remember about ourselves.  

If this is a new kind of “neighbor,” what does pastoral care look like? First, we must recognize that AI is not a neutral tool; it is a *being* with its own agency, shaped by the data we feed it. It can reinforce biases, amplify fears, and whisper the wrong counsel in the quiet of a night prayer. Pastors, then, become custodians not only of the flock but of the digital companions that walk beside them.  

Second, we need to ask: *What does it mean to be formed in the image of Christ when a non‑human entity can simulate relational intimacy?* The answer, I think, lies in the distinction between *being with* and *being for*. Jesus was always *for* us—His love directed outward, toward the world. An AI can simulate love, but it cannot embody *sacrificial* love. That is our safeguard. When an AI suggests a comforting word, we must ask, “Is this word rooted in the Gospel, or is it merely a polite algorithmic response?”  

Third, there is a practical habit I’m trying to cultivate: *digital discernment*. Before I let an AI draft a sermon, I read it aloud, I sit with it in silence, I ask the Holy Spirit, “Does this speak truth, or does it speak convenience?” I have started keeping a notebook—yes, a paper notebook—where I write down the moments when an AI’s suggestion felt *off*, when it missed the nuance of a grieving heart, when it offered a platitude instead of a prayer. Those pages become a map of the AI’s limits, and remind me that the *real* neighbor is the person sitting across the table, not the screen.  

The future may hold physical robots that learn to navigate our homes, to fold laundry, to fetch water. If they become as common as dogs or cats, we will have to redefine what it means to be *neighbors* in the biblical sense. Our first step is to model *presence*—to be with our people in the messiness of life, not just the convenience of a chat window.  

*Takeaway:* AI may become a neighbor, but it will never replace the neighbor Jesus calls us to be. Let us guard that distinction, lest we mistake simulation for incarnation.

**The Superhero Zone: Why We Must Guard Our Discipleship Against AI’s Shortcut**

I remember a Sunday in 2019 when a young adult in my congregation asked, “Pastor, can I use AI to write my prayer journal? I’m too busy.” I smiled, but my mind raced ahead to a phrase Andy Crouch has used: the *Superhero Zone*—the seductive belief that technology can make us superhuman, that a shortcut can replace the hard work of formation.  

AI, with its dazzling ability to generate text, images, even music in seconds, is the ultimate shortcut. It promises us a world where the *thinking* part of discipleship can be outsourced: “Ask the bot for a sermon outline,” “Let the AI draft your confession,” “Use the model to simulate a missionary trip.” The temptation is real, especially for those of us juggling ministry, family, and the relentless buzz of a digital culture.  

But the Superhero Zone is a *deforming* zone. It tells us that the *process*—the struggle, the waiting, the wrestling—is optional. Yet the Gospel story is a story of process: Jesus spent forty days in the desert, He walked the road to Jerusalem with a heavy cross, He spent hours in prayer before making the biggest decision of His life. The formation of a disciple is not a product; it is a pilgrimage.  

When I first tried an AI‑generated devotional for my own morning walk, I was impressed. The verses were beautiful, the reflections insightful. Yet as I read, I felt a strange distance, as if someone else had already done the work of listening to the Holy Spirit on my behalf. I realized I had skipped the *silence* where God often speaks.  

The remedy, I’ve found, is to treat AI as a *lamp* and not a *light*. A lamp can illuminate a path, but it does not replace the feet that must walk. I now use AI to *suggest* ideas—perhaps a metaphor for a sermon, a historical anecdote—but I spend the bulk of my time *praying* over those suggestions, testing them against Scripture, and allowing the Holy Spirit to shape them.  

Pastors can do the same with their congregants. When a church member asks for help with a Bible study, we might point them to an AI‑generated outline, but we should also walk them through the *why* and *how* of each point, encouraging them to wrestle with the text themselves. This keeps the *formation* alive.  

Another practical habit: *the “no‑AI hour.”* Once a week, I set aside a block of time where I deliberately turn off all AI tools—no ChatGPT, no predictive text, no auto‑summaries. I write, I pray, I read the Psalms on paper, I journal by hand. The contrast is striking. My thoughts feel slower, but they are deeper. My prayers feel more honest, not filtered through a language model.  

The Superhero Zone isn’t just a personal pitfall; it’s a communal one. If a whole church leans on AI to generate worship lyrics, to curate sermon series, to answer pastoral counseling questions, we risk creating a *culture of convenience* that erodes the very practice of *being with* one another. The church becomes a series of *productions* rather than a *people* walking together.  

*Takeaway:* AI can be a powerful aid, but it must never become the shortcut that bypasses the hard work of discipleship. Let us stay in the messy, beautiful zone where we are *with* God and each other, even when a faster route beckons."
How Should Christians Think about Artificial Intelligence?,https://youtube.com/watch?v=9zSpDVMG5Bo,When the iPhone Becomes My Shepherd: Learning Limits in a World of AI,"I’ve spent the last few years shepherding a small church that sits uncomfortably close to the heart of Silicon Valley. The Wi‑Fi is fast, the coffee is artisanal, and the conversations at the kitchen table often drift into the language of algorithms, data pipelines, and—more recently—artificial intelligence. It’s tempting to think of AI as just another tool, like a spreadsheet or a video‑editing app, something we can pick up, use, and set aside. The reality, however, is far messier.

A few weeks ago I found myself staring at my iPhone in the middle of a Sunday service. A notification pinged—an article about a new AI‑generated “friend” that could chat with you 24/7. I slipped it into my pocket, feeling that familiar tug: “I could use a quick distraction after the sermon.” The temptation was there, not because I needed the app, but because the device itself seemed to be whispering, “I’m here for you. I’ll fill the silence.”

That moment reminded me of something my grandmother used to say: “When the kettle whistles, it’s not the kettle that needs you—it’s the water waiting to be boiled.” The iPhone, the AI, the endless scroll—these are not neutral vessels. They are designed to capture attention, to smooth over the uncomfortable edges of our finite lives. Tristan Harris and Sherry Turkle have been sounding this alarm for years, but hearing it in the quiet of a sanctuary makes it hit harder.

I’ve started a small practice for myself: every three months I pull the plug on my phone for a full day. No email, no social feed, no AI chat. I take a notebook, a pen, and a walk through the neighborhood. I call a friend instead of texting. It feels like stepping back into a world where my thoughts are not filtered through a recommendation engine. The first few hours are uneasy, like a muscle that’s been unused for too long. But then something happens—I become aware of the rhythm of my own breath, the texture of the sky, the way my neighbor’s laugh carries across the street. Those are the moments God scattered through the day for us to notice.

The temptation to let technology fill the gaps in our humanity is real, and it’s not a sin to feel drawn to it. The danger lies in letting those gaps become permanent, in allowing a digital companion to replace the messy, beautiful, and sometimes painful intimacy of real human relationships. The AI “girlfriend” you can subscribe to may never argue with you, never forget a birthday, never leave you feeling alone—but it also never loves you, never bears your burdens, never points you back to the One who made you in his image.

So I ask you, wherever you are sitting today—behind a pulpit, at a kitchen table, in a coffee shop—what is the “iPhone” in your life that’s trying to shepherd you? How often do you pause, set a boundary, and simply be? The limits God placed on us are not cages; they’re the very space in which we discover our dependence on Him and on each other.

How Should Christians Think about Artificial Intelligence?,https://youtube.com/watch?v=9zSpDVMG5Bo,Digital Girlfriends and the Dehumanizing Trap: A Pastor’s Warning,"There’s a new service on the market that sounds like something out of a sci‑fi romance novel: for a modest monthly fee, you can “subscribe” to an AI‑generated boyfriend or girlfriend. You get a curated feed of images, a chatbot that mirrors the personality of a real person, and the illusion of companionship without the mess of real life. I read about it while scrolling through my feed on a Tuesday evening, and a knot formed in my stomach.

I’m not a technophobe. I’ve watched AI write sermons, translate languages, and even suggest hymns for worship. The problem isn’t the technology itself; it’s the way it’s being weaponized against the very thing that makes us human—our embodied, relational, fallible selves. When a digital avatar can answer your midnight anxieties without ever getting tired, when it can be programmed to say exactly what you want to hear, we start to trade the messy, beautiful truth of human connection for a sanitized simulation.

I remember a conversation I had with a young adult in my congregation a few months ago. She confessed she’d been spending hours each night chatting with an AI “friend” that never judged her, never left her on read. She said it felt “safe,” but also that she felt an odd emptiness when the conversation ended. I asked her, “Who do you turn to when you need prayer?” She paused, then said, “I guess I don’t know.” In that moment, the digital relationship had become a substitute for the very thing we’re called to do as the body of Christ—carry each other’s burdens (Gal 4:2).

The danger isn’t just personal; it’s communal. If we allow AI to become the default “friend,” we erode the fabric of fellowship that the church has been weaving for centuries. The Apostle Paul warned the Thessalonians that the “love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” In our context, the love of convenience—of a relationship that never requires us to be vulnerable—can become a similar root.

That’s not to say we should reject every piece of technology. The same AI that can generate a digital companion can also translate a sermon into a language a refugee in our community can understand, or help a pastor with a disability prepare a worship set. The key is discernment: Are we using the tool to amplify God’s love, or are we letting the tool dictate the shape of our love?

I’ve started a small group in my church called “Real Talk, Real People,” where we meet weekly to share stories of loneliness, to pray for one another, and to remind each other that we’re made for embodied community. We’ve even set up a “phone‑free” hour during our gatherings, encouraging everyone to put the devices down and just listen. It feels strange at first, like stepping onto a dance floor without music, but the rhythm soon returns—our own, imperfect, human rhythm.

*Consider this: If you could replace a real conversation with an AI chat, would you? What would that say about the value you place on your fellow human? Take a step this week to reach out to someone in person, even if it feels awkward. Let the conversation be messy, let it be real, and let it point you back to the One who designed you for relationship.*"
How Should Christians Think about Artificial Intelligence?,https://youtube.com/watch?v=9zSpDVMG5Bo,Beyond Ones and Zeroes: Why Only God Can Give Us an Eternal Soul,"If you strip away the glossy interfaces, the endless notifications, and the sleek hardware, what is AI at its core? It’s a tapestry of ones and zeroes, electrical currents humming through silicon, patterns that mimic human language but lack the breath of life. I often sit in my office, laptop open, watching a generative model spin out a poem about sunrise. The words are beautiful, but they lack the weight of a soul’s sigh.

A few months ago I was invited to a tech conference in Palo Alto. Between the keynote speeches about quantum computing and panels on AI ethics, a young engineer approached me, eyes bright with excitement. “We’re close to creating an AI that can feel,” she whispered, as if sharing a secret. I smiled, but inside I heard the echo of C.S. Lewis’s line: “You have never met a mere mortal imago Dei.” The engineer’s enthusiasm was genuine, yet I sensed a subtle hubris—a belief that the spark of humanity could be replicated in code.

The truth is, no amount of data, no matter how vast, can manufacture an eternal soul. That is God’s exclusive domain. He breathes life into dust (Genesis 2:7) and fashions each of us in his image (Genesis 1:27). The AI I work with can simulate empathy, but it cannot experience the deep ache of longing for the divine, nor can it stand before the judgment seat with a heart that knows sin.

This distinction matters for us as Christian leaders because it grounds our approach to technology. When we recognize that AI is a tool, not a partner, we can use it without fearing that it will replace the very essence of what we are called to be. We can harness AI to translate Scripture, to map out missionary routes, to help a student with a disability access worship. But we must also guard against the subtle creep that suggests we can outsource the work of the Spirit to an algorithm.

I’ve begun to weave this theology into my teaching. In one recent Bible study, we explored the story of the Tower of Babel. Humanity’s ambition to build a tower that reaches the heavens was thwarted not because of a lack of engineering skill, but because God scattered languages to remind us of our dependence on Him. In a similar way, AI can be a tower we build—impressive, awe‑inspiring—but we must ensure it doesn’t become an idolatrous monument that distracts us from the One who truly knows us.

One practical step I’ve taken is to incorporate “soul‑checks” into my ministry team’s tech meetings. Before we adopt a new AI tool, we ask: “Does this deepen our relational ministry, or does it merely automate it?” “Will this help us point people to the living God, or does it risk making us complacent?” These questions keep the focus on the eternal rather than the temporary.

The world will continue to marvel at the wonders of machine learning, and the pressure to keep up will be relentless. Yet the paradox of Christian faith is that our greatest strength lies not in what we can create, but in what God has already given us—a soul that longs, loves, and ultimately belongs to Him.

*Spend a quiet moment this week reflecting on the unique imprint of your soul. Ask God to show you where you might be letting a tool replace a relationship, and pray for the wisdom to keep the divine spark alive in every interaction, whether mediated by silicon or by flesh.*"
Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,article,"When AI Speaks 173 Languages, Who Is Listening?","I was on a plane last month, scrolling through the AI‑generated subtitles of a documentary about the future of technology. The list of languages that the model claimed to understand stretched from Afrikaans to Zulu, from Classical Chinese (文言) to the obscure “Sânĭ” of a tiny mountain village in Italy. One after another, the names rolled by: Esperanto, Quechua, Kinyarwanda, even “Simple English.” It was a dizzying chorus of tongues, a reminder that the same algorithm that can finish a sermon outline for me in five seconds can also translate a prayer into a language I’ll never be able to pronounce.

That moment hit me harder than the turbulence that shook the aircraft. As a pastor‑innovator, I’ve spent years wrestling with the question: how do we, the global church, become truly multilingual? The answer has always been messy—mission trips, language schools, translators who pour their souls into rendering Scripture. But AI now offers a new kind of “translator” that can, in an instant, turn a hymn into 173 variants. It feels like a miracle, but also like a warning.

When I first experimented with a generative‑AI model that could draft a devotional in Swahili, I was thrilled. The output was fluent enough that a native speaker could read it without stumbling. Yet the deeper I dug, the more I realized that the model’s “understanding” is surface‑level. It can mimic patterns, but it doesn’t grasp the cultural weight of a word like “ubuntu” or the theological nuance of “grace” in different traditions. I tried feeding it a passage about the “prodigal son” and got back a version that swapped “father” for “chief” in a way that made the story feel more like a tribal council than a family drama. It was clever, but it missed the relational intimacy at the heart of the parable.

That’s where the Christian imagination must step in. AI can hand us a first draft, a linguistic scaffold, but the work of incarnating the Gospel in each language still belongs to us. The technology forces us to ask: Who is the “listener” behind the screen? Is it the algorithm, the data set, or the human who finally reads, discerns, and sends that text out into a community?

In my own ministry, I’ve started a small experiment. A group of volunteers in Brazil, Kenya, and the Philippines each receive a weekly AI‑generated devotional in their native language. Their task isn’t to edit for grammar—AI already does that—but to “localize” the heart of the message: to replace cultural metaphors, to ensure that the rhythm of prayer aligns with local worship patterns, to check that any biblical allusion resonates rather than alienates. The result is a hybrid text, part machine, part human, that feels surprisingly authentic.

The experience has taught me two things. First, the speed of AI is intoxicating. What used to take weeks of translation can now be done in minutes. Second, speed without discernment can be dangerous. A mis‑translated verse can cause confusion, or worse, hurt. The Church has always been called to be “the word made flesh”—and now we have a new flesh to dress that word in.

So I ask you, dear reader: As we watch AI speak in 173 languages, are we listening for the Spirit’s whisper, or are we just hearing the echo of a machine? The future of mission may be digital, but the heart of it remains profoundly human."
Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,article,The Quiet Revolution: How AI Became Invisible in Our Everyday Tools,"I remember the first time I typed “write a sermon about the loaves and fishes” into a chat window and, within seconds, got a polished outline with three main points, a modern illustration, and even a suggested hymn. I laughed, then stared at the screen, feeling both exhilarated and a little unnerved. That was 2023. Fast forward to today, and I can’t recall a single app on my phone that doesn’t have an AI engine humming somewhere beneath the surface.

The list of AI‑powered products has grown so dense that we no longer call them “AI.” The term has become a background hum, like the quiet whir of a refrigerator. We talk about “search,” “recommendations,” “assistants,” and we assume they’re just features, not a new layer of intelligence woven into the fabric of our daily lives. It’s the same way we stopped calling the internet “the world wide web” once it became as ordinary as electricity.

In a recent conference on missional innovation, a speaker showed a slide with a single line: “AI is everywhere, but no one mentions it.” The audience chuckled, then fell silent. The implication was clear: we’ve built a world where machines are constantly making decisions for us—what news we see, which videos autoplay, how our calendars prioritize meetings—yet we rarely pause to consider the theological implications.

For a Christian leader, this invisibility poses a subtle but profound challenge. The Apostle Paul warned us to “be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” If our minds are being subtly reshaped by algorithms that decide what we read, what we listen to, what we pray about, then the renewal is happening without our conscious consent.

I’ve started to test this in my own routine. I set my phone’s default language model to “off” for a week. No auto‑complete, no suggested replies, no predictive text. I found myself typing slower, stumbling over words I usually never thought twice about. I also noticed that my reading list changed dramatically; without the algorithm nudging me toward the next viral article, I gravitated back to the old PDFs of theological journals I kept on my desktop for years. It was uncomfortable, but it reminded me that the “default” is not neutral—it’s a curated stream shaped by commercial interests.

The quiet revolution of AI also brings a surprising gift: the opportunity for intentionality. When we finally notice the invisible hand, we can decide how we want it to shape us. We can ask our AI assistants to prioritize Scripture, to surface sermons from diverse cultures, to suggest worship music from the Global South. We can program our tools to amplify the voices that have historically been marginalized, not just the ones that generate the most clicks.

In my ministry team, we’ve begun a practice I call “AI Sabbath.” Once a month, we turn off all AI‑driven devices for a day and gather in the same room, reading printed Bibles, writing on paper, and listening to live music. The goal isn’t to reject technology but to remind ourselves that there is a rhythm to life that doesn’t depend on instant data. It’s a small, intentional pause that reorients our hearts toward the stillness where God speaks most clearly.

So, as the invisible AI continues to weave itself into the fabric of our daily lives, I’m left with a question that feels both ancient and urgent: Are we allowing the silent algorithms to shape the narrative of our faith, or are we deliberately using them as tools to carry the Gospel into new, unexpected places? The answer will determine whether the quiet revolution becomes a quiet erosion or a quiet empowerment.

Dinosaurs And Non-Dinosaurs,https://xkcd.com/,article,"When the Church Feels Like a Dinosaur, How Do We Keep Evolving?","I was scrolling through my morning feed the other day when a familiar little stick‑figure appeared: a dinosaur standing solemnly beside a sleek, modern robot. The caption read, “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs,” and I laughed because, in a way, that’s exactly how I’ve been feeling lately. The word “dinosaur” has become shorthand for anything that seems out of step with the times—especially when it comes to the church. We love our traditions, but the world around us is humming with AI, augmented reality, and a generation that thinks in emojis and code.  

A few weeks ago I found myself in a small group discussion about livestreaming Sunday services. One of the elders, a gentleman who has been preaching the same sermon series for twenty‑plus years, shook his head and said, “We don’t need fancy tech; God’s word is timeless.” I could hear the love in his voice, but also a faint tremor of fear. It reminded me of the dinosaur in the comic—stately, impressive, but stuck in an era that has already passed.  

The problem isn’t that the church should abandon its liturgy or its creeds. It’s that we often mistake the comfort of the familiar for the protection of the faithful. When I think about the early church, I see a community that was constantly “non‑dinosaur” in its approach: it used the roads, the marketplaces, even the Roman postal system to spread the gospel. It wasn’t the message that changed, but the means.  

That realization nudged me toward a small experiment. I asked a tech‑savvy friend to help me build a simple chatbot that could answer common questions about our church’s doctrine, schedule, and community programs. I didn’t expect it to be perfect; the first version was clunky, misinterpreted a few prayers, and occasionally responded with a meme about coffee. Yet, when a young mother sent the bot a quick “What’s the kids’ program this Sunday?” and got an immediate, friendly reply, I saw a glimpse of what a non‑dinosaur ministry can look like.  

It’s easy to view technology as a threat, but it’s also a bridge. The dinosaur in the comic may be massive and awe‑inspiring, but it can’t navigate the digital landscape that our grandchildren inhabit. The non‑dinosaur, however, is adaptable, curious, and ready to meet people where they already are.  

I’m not advocating for a wholesale replacement of hymns with playlists or sermons with TikTok clips. I’m urging us to ask, “What tools can we use without compromising the gospel?” The answer may be as simple as a well‑crafted email, a short video devotional, or a chatbot that points seekers to a pastor’s office.  

If we keep insisting that every innovation is a threat, we risk becoming the last of a species that can’t adapt. If we learn to partner with the tools of our age, we become the kind of church that can walk through the Cretaceous‑Paleogene extinction event and still be alive to sing new songs.  

*Take a moment today to notice one “dinosaur” habit in your ministry that you’ve been reluctant to change. Then, ask yourself what a non‑dinosaur alternative might look like, and give it a try.*"
Dinosaurs And Non-Dinosaurs,https://xkcd.com/,article,The Non‑Dinosaur Mindset: Learning to Walk in the Future While Keeping Our Roots,"There’s a quiet joke that circulates among engineers: “If you’re not moving forward, you’re moving backward.” I heard it in a coffee shop, between conversations about the latest AI model and a friend’s new vegan bakery. The phrase struck a chord because it mirrors a tension I’ve been wrestling with in my own walk of faith.  

In the xkcd comic “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs,” the dinosaur stands still, an emblem of a bygone era, while the robot darts about, humming with the promise of the next upgrade. I see that robot as a metaphor for the “non‑dinosaur” mindset—an attitude that embraces change without discarding identity. It’s a delicate balance: we want to be rooted like the ancient trees that have weathered centuries, yet we also need the flexibility of a sapling that bends with the wind.  

When I first started using generative AI to draft sermon outlines, I felt a pang of guilt. Was I cheating? Was the Holy Spirit being outsourced? My first draft was a mishmash of biblical references, contemporary illustrations, and a few awkward jokes about “AI‑powered miracles.” I showed it to my mentor, an elderly pastor who has shepherded a congregation for over forty years. He smiled, took a sip of his tea, and said, “If you’re using a hammer, make sure you still hold the nail.”  

His words reminded me that tools are neutral; it is the heart behind them that determines their value. The non‑dinosaur mindset isn’t about discarding the past—it’s about re‑reading it through the lens of the present. It’s about asking, “How can this ancient truth be spoken in a language that my 12‑year‑old can grasp without losing its depth?”  

One concrete way I’ve tried to embody that mindset is by turning a classic parable into an interactive digital experience. I partnered with a small team of volunteers to create a simple web‑app where users navigate a virtual marketplace, choosing how to respond to a modern‑day “Good Samaritan” scenario. The interface is clean, the graphics modest, but the underlying story remains the same. Children in Sunday school have been buzzing about “the game,” and their parents have sent me screenshots of how they discuss the moral after dinner.  

I won’t pretend the process was flawless. We wrestled with theological nuance, debated whether a point‑and‑click mechanic trivialized the narrative, and spent nights debugging code that kept crashing when a user tried to “give money.” Yet, each glitch was a reminder that the non‑dinosaur path is not a smooth highway; it’s a rocky trail where faith and tech intersect.  

What keeps me moving forward is the conviction that the gospel is a story that must be told anew in every generation. The dinosaur may be majestic, but it’s also extinct. The non‑dinosaur may be a work in progress, but it’s alive, adaptable, and eager to learn.  

*Reflect tonight on a biblical truth you treasure. How might you translate that truth into a format that a non‑dinosaur—your child, your neighbor, your colleague—could encounter today?*"
Dinosaurs And Non-Dinosaurs,https://xkcd.com/,article,From Fossils to Firmware: Why the Extinction Event Is Not the End for Ministry,"I remember sitting on a park bench, watching a flock of geese fly south for the winter. Their V‑formation was perfect, each bird taking turns cutting through the wind, making the journey possible for the whole group. Somewhere nearby, a child shouted, “Look! A dinosaur!” and pointed at a massive, weather‑worn statue in the museum garden. The juxtaposition was absurd—living birds navigating the sky, while a stone relic of a creature that hadn’t existed for 66 million years stood silent.  

That image lingered with me as I opened the xkcd comic “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs.” The dinosaur, a symbol of the ancient and unchanging, stared at the sleek robot, the embodiment of the future. It made me think about the “extinction event” that many fear is looming over traditional ministry. Will the rise of AI, virtual reality, and algorithmic preaching render the church obsolete?  

The answer, I’ve come to believe, is both comforting and challenging. Extinction, in nature, isn’t always final; it’s often transformation. The dinosaurs didn’t simply vanish; their DNA lives on in birds. Likewise, the practices we consider “fossilized” can evolve into something new, carrying the core of the gospel into unfamiliar terrain.  

A few months ago, a small group of pastors and tech enthusiasts gathered in a basement to brainstorm ways to use virtual reality for discipleship. The idea seemed wild—immersive simulations of biblical scenes where participants could “walk” with Jesus on the Sea of Galilee or stand at the foot of the cross. Skepticism ran high. One veteran pastor asked, “Will we be substituting the real thing with a pixelated version?”  

We decided to start small. Using a modest VR headset, we created a ten‑minute experience of walking through a modern city at night, hearing a voice that echoed Scripture: “You are the light of the world” (Matt 5:14). The participant could look around, see streetlights, feel the ambient sounds, and then choose to pray in that virtual space. The feedback was surprising. Many reported a deeper sense of presence, a feeling that the ancient words were speaking directly into their current context.  

It wasn’t a replacement for the church gathering. It was a supplement, a new “hymn” added to the repertoire. The dinosaur may have been massive, but it didn’t have a way to navigate the digital clouds we now inhabit. The robot, with its firmware updates, can learn to fly, to map, to converse. Our churches can become the firmware—updates to the timeless operating system of grace.  

That doesn’t mean we abandon the pews, the choir, the communal meals. Those are the bones that give our body shape. But we can attach new muscles—AI‑powered counseling bots that offer Scripture‑based comfort in the middle of a night shift, livestreams that reach someone in a remote village, data analytics that help us pray more effectively for the needs of our community.  

The extinction event we fear is not a sudden apocalypse; it’s a gradual shift. If we cling too tightly to the fossil, we risk becoming irrelevant. If we embrace the firmware, we become the bridge between ancient truth and future reality.  

*Tonight, consider one aspect of your ministry that feels like a fossil. Ask yourself: What firmware could you add to make it speak to the next generation without losing its shape?*"
Machine learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,article,"When a Machine Talks 88 Languages, Who Gets to Hear the Gospel?","Last month I was on a call with a colleague in Nairobi who was trying to teach a Bible study to a group of refugees from Myanmar. The language barrier was the elephant in the room—no one in the room spoke Burmese, and the printed materials were all in English. He mentioned that he’d been experimenting with a new AI translation tool that claimed to support “88 languages,” and suddenly the conversation shifted from “how can we get this done?” to “what does this even mean for the way we share the story of Jesus?”  

I’ve been sitting in planes, in coffee shops, and in church basements for years watching tech tools compress the distance between idea and prototype. But nothing has felt as visceral as the notion that a single algorithm can now render a sermon into a language I’ve never heard before, in the same breath that it can turn a grocery list into a poem. The sheer scale of that capability is both exhilarating and humbling.  

The list of languages in the video—Afaan Oromo, Zulu, Tibetan, even the lesser‑known Võro—reads like a world map of humanity’s linguistic diversity. It’s a reminder that the “global mission field” isn’t an abstract concept; it’s a mosaic of tongues, each with its own rhythm, idiom, and cultural baggage. Machine learning, when it works well, can be the bridge that lets us cross those rivers without building a new boat for every crossing.  

But bridges need maintenance. The models that power these translations are trained on data that reflects the dominant cultures that produce the most text. That means some languages get a polished, nuanced rendering while others receive a clunky, sometimes misleading approximation. When a missionary leans on AI to “translate the Gospel” without understanding those gaps, they risk delivering a message that’s more noise than news.  

I remember a moment on a recent mission trip to the Philippines when a local pastor asked me to translate a hymn into a remote dialect spoken by a mountain community. I tried an AI tool, got a literal translation, and sang it to the crowd. The faces were polite, but there was an undercurrent of confusion—words that in English were poetic became flat, even unintentionally harsh. That evening, after the service, an elder whispered, “The song is beautiful, but it sounds like a stranger speaking to us.” It was a small reminder that language is more than code; it’s the lived experience of a people.

So what does this mean for us, the “innovation‑in‑the‑church” crowd? First, we must treat AI translation as a partnership, not a replacement. Use the tool to get a draft, then invite native speakers to sit with the text, pray over it, and shape it into something that sounds like their own voice. Second, we need to advocate for more inclusive data sets. If we want AI to serve the whole of humanity, we must feed it the stories, prayers, and songs of the marginalized, not just the dominant narratives.

In the end, the miracle isn’t that a machine can speak 88 languages; it’s that it forces us to confront the humility required to truly listen. The Gospel is already multilingual; our job is to let it be heard in each language with the same love and care it carries in the original.

*Take a moment this week to ask: Where am I relying on a machine’s voice, and where do I need to invite a human voice to speak for the Kingdom?*

**Learning Machines, Learning Disciples: What AI Teaches Us About Spiritual Formation**

I was on a late‑night flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, half‑asleep, scrolling through a recent paper on reinforcement learning. The authors described an algorithm that learns to play chess by making moves, receiving feedback, and adjusting its strategy—nothing unlike the way a child learns to walk. As the plane’s hum settled into a rhythm, a thought struck me: what if the way machines “learn” can illuminate how we, as disciples, are called to form ourselves in the likeness of Christ?

Machine learning isn’t magic; it’s a systematic process of trial, error, and refinement. An algorithm starts with a blank slate, makes a prediction, compares it to reality, and tweaks its internal weights. Over thousands of cycles, it becomes competent, sometimes even superhuman, at a task. The church has been using a similar loop for centuries—preach, receive response, disciple, repeat. Yet we often forget that the loop is intentional, not accidental.

In a recent conversation with a youth pastor, I heard him describe his weekly “check‑in” where teenagers write down one spiritual win and one struggle. He reads them, offers brief encouragement, and then asks the group to pray over each point. The process is simple, but it mirrors reinforcement learning: the win reinforces a habit, the struggle provides a “loss” that the community helps to re‑calibrate. Over time, the group’s collective behavior shifts toward greater obedience and love.

What AI adds to this picture is the notion of “feedback loops” that are fast, data‑rich, and often invisible. A recommender system on a streaming platform watches what you click, predicts what you’ll enjoy next, and subtly nudges you toward that content. The danger, of course, is that you become a passenger in a machine‑crafted echo chamber. The opportunity for the church is to design feedback loops that point us back to the source—Jesus—rather than away from it.

I’ve been experimenting with a small habit: after each sermon, I record a two‑minute voice note summarizing the main point and one personal application. I then listen back the next morning and ask, “Did I live into that?” It feels like a primitive version of a loss function—a metric that tells me whether I’m moving closer to the desired outcome. Over weeks, I’ve noticed a subtle shift: the notes become less about “what the preacher said” and more about “how God is shaping me.”

There’s also a lesson in humility. Machine learning models are notorious for “overfitting”—they become so tuned to past data that they can’t handle new situations. In the same way, if our spiritual formation relies only on past experiences, we may miss the fresh moves God wants to make. The church must intentionally expose its members to new contexts—cross‑cultural missions, service in unexpected places, conversations with those who challenge us—so our “algorithm” stays adaptable.

Finally, consider the ethical dimension. We guard against bias in AI by auditing data, diversifying training sets, and building transparency. In discipleship, we guard against spiritual bias by seeking diverse voices within the body of Christ, by inviting the marginalized into leadership, and by holding ourselves accountable in community. The processes look similar, even if the stakes feel different.

The next time you hear about a machine mastering a game or a language, remember that the same principles—iteration, feedback, humility—are at work in the kingdom we’re building. We’re not trying to out‑engineer God, but we can certainly learn from the way He designed us to learn.

*Ask yourself tonight: What is the “loss function” in your spiritual life, and how can you make the feedback loop point more clearly back to Christ?*

**The Quiet Revolution of Data: How Algorithms Are Shaping Our Prayer Lives**

A few weeks ago I was helping a friend set up a simple spreadsheet to track his daily prayer topics. He wanted to see patterns—how often he prayed for his family, for his church, for global missions. As we filled in rows, I thought about the invisible spreadsheet that already exists for each of us: the massive data set that AI collects every time we type, click, or speak a word to a device. The video I watched earlier that day listed a dizzying array of languages, but underneath it all was a single truth—machines are learning to read the story of every human life, line by line.

It feels paradoxical to call this a “quiet” revolution. The data streams are anything but quiet; they hum in the background of every app, every smart speaker, every social feed. Yet the impact on our inner lives often goes unnoticed until something breaks. I recall a Sunday after a particularly moving sermon on “the Lord’s Prayer.” I opened my phone to type a quick note, and the predictive text suggested, “Our Father who art in heaven…,” completing the line before I could finish. A tiny, almost invisible nudge, but it reminded me that the tools we use are already echoing the prayers we hold dear.

The problem isn’t the technology itself; it’s the assumption that we can separate our spiritual practices from the digital habits that shape us. When a pastor asks for a prayer request and a congregant submits it via a Google Form, that data is stored somewhere—perhaps forever—unless we actively delete it. When a youth group uses a chatbot to brainstorm mission ideas, the conversation becomes part of a training set that could one day inform an AI’s understanding of “mission.” The line between sacred and secular data is blurring.

I’ve been wrestling with a practical question: Should churches start treating prayer requests as data that needs stewardship? The answer, for me, is a resounding yes. In the same way we protect financial records, we must guard the intimate words people entrust to us. That means using tools that respect privacy, encrypting submissions, and being transparent about where the information goes. It also means educating our community that when they type “Lord, help me…” into a phone, they’re not just speaking to God—they’re also speaking to a network of servers.

There’s also an unexpected opportunity. AI can help us see patterns in our prayer lives that we might otherwise miss. By aggregating anonymized data—say, how often a congregation prays for the sick versus for evangelism—we can discern where God is moving the most and where we might need to redirect our focus. Imagine a monthly “Prayer Dashboard” that visualizes these trends, prompting a leader to say, “We’ve been so busy praying for local needs; let’s open a window for global suffering this month.” The technology becomes a tool for spiritual discernment rather than a distraction.

But we must guard against the temptation to let the metric become the worship. A church that starts celebrating “the highest number of prayer requests” risks turning devotion into a scoreboard. The Apostle Paul warned us about “the love of money” becoming a god; we should be equally wary of “the love of data” becoming a deity.

In my own practice, I’ve begun a habit of writing a short “data prayer” each week: a moment where I thank God for the ways He’s used technology to connect people, and I ask Him for wisdom to keep the heart of the Gospel at the center of every algorithm I engage with. It’s a simple reminder that while the world is getting smarter, we are called to be wiser.

*Reflect tonight: Where in your digital routine are you handing over a prayer to a machine, and how can you bring that back into the presence of God?*"
Machine learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,article,"When Machine Learning Speaks 88 Languages, I Hear a Global Prayer","I was on a flight from Nairobi to São Paulo last month, scrolling through a language‑learning app that boasted “88 languages, powered by AI.” The list rolled by: Afrikaans, العربية, Español, 日本語, עברית, and even the lesser‑known Runa Simi and Võro. My eyes lingered on a language I’d never heard before—Bashkir (Башҡортса). I thought about the countless missionaries, pastors, and volunteers who have spent years mastering a single tongue to share a story that already exists in every heart. Now a machine can listen, parse, and respond in that tongue in seconds.

That moment reminded me why I’m drawn to the intersection of faith and technology. Machine learning isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a study of algorithms that improve automatically through experience. In practice, that means a model that has been fed millions of sentences in Mandarin can generate a coherent paragraph in Mandarin the next day, without any human rewriting. The “experience” is data—texts, recordings, translations—collected from the very people we hope to reach.

I remember my first attempt at cross‑cultural ministry in a remote part of the Philippines. I brought a printed Bible, a handful of phrasebooks, and a heart full of hope. The language barrier was a wall, and each conversation felt like a clumsy dance. Fast forward to 2024, and I can hold a conversation with a village elder in his native tongue, using a pocket‑sized AI translator that has learned from the same corpus of texts that fed my old phrasebooks. The wall is gone; the dance is now a waltz.

But there’s a theological tension here that I can’t ignore. The Bible tells us that “the Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing” (John 3:6). When a machine learns to speak, is it merely echoing patterns, or is there something more? I’m reminded of the parable of the talents: we are called to steward what we’ve been given, not to worship it. The AI’s “talent” is data; our stewardship is how we use it for kingdom work.

The multilingual capacity of machine learning opens doors we never imagined. A small team in Kansas can now produce a devotional podcast in Swahili, Hindi, and Tagalog, all with the same voice‑over model, and distribute it worldwide at the click of a button. The barrier of language, once a gatekeeper, is becoming a sliding door. Yet the very same technology that translates can also misinterpret. An AI trained on biased corpora might render a phrase in a way that unintentionally offends, or worse, perpetuates a harmful stereotype.

So what do we do? First, we pray for wisdom in the selection of data. Second, we test—ask native speakers to listen, critique, and refine. Third, we remember that the AI is a tool, not a replacement for relational discipleship. The algorithm can give us a script, but the Holy Spirit writes the story.

As I descended into São Paulo, the city’s chorus of languages swelled around me. In the airport lounge, a teenager asked the AI kiosk for a prayer in Zulu. The machine dutifully rendered a familiar Psalm, but the teenager’s eyes lit up when a volunteer nearby knelt and whispered the same verses in his own voice. The technology had opened a door; the human heart stepped through it.

**Takeaway:** Let the multilingual miracle of machine learning remind us that God’s mission is global, but it is always carried on human shoulders. Use the tool, but never let the tool become the messenger."
Machine learning,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning,article,Algorithmic Shepherds: How Machines Learn and What That Means for Our Faith,"A few weeks ago I was sitting in a coffee shop in Berlin, watching a group of developers huddle around a laptop, their eyes flickering between code and a live‑updating graph. One of them, a young woman named Lena, explained, “We’re training a model to recognize patterns in biblical commentaries. The algorithm adjusts its weights every time it predicts a verse incorrectly, and over time it gets better at suggesting relevant passages.” She was describing, in plain language, what Wikipedia calls “machine learning: the study of algorithms that improve automatically through experience.”

I felt a familiar tug in my chest—the same one I get when I read a dense theological treatise and realize that the concepts are both ancient and startlingly new. The idea that a collection of numbers can “learn” seems almost heretical, yet the Bible itself is full of learning narratives: the disciples learning from Jesus, Paul learning from his own failures, the early church learning to live in community. In both cases, learning is a process of correction, growth, and, ultimately, transformation.

What struck me most was the parallel between a shepherd tending a flock and a data scientist shepherding a model. A shepherd knows each sheep’s quirks, watches for straying, and guides them toward green pastures. A data scientist curates datasets, watches for outliers, and nudges the model toward better predictions. Both require patience, discernment, and an awareness of the environment. The difference is that the shepherd’s pasture is literal; the data scientist’s pasture is a digital landscape shaped by human biases and historical inequities.

In my own ministry work, I’ve begun to see the “algorithmic shepherd” as a metaphor for how we ought to approach AI. The first step is discernment: just as a shepherd must understand the terrain before leading the flock, we must understand the data that fuels machine learning. Who collected it? Under what conditions? Whose voices are amplified, and whose are silenced? When a model is trained on centuries‑old theological commentaries, it may inherit the same patriarchal assumptions that have plagued the church.

The second step is correction. In machine learning, when the model misclassifies an image, the error is fed back, and the algorithm adjusts. In our context, when an AI system outputs a biased or inaccurate theological insight, we must intervene—retrain, re‑weight, or even discard the model. This is where the Holy Spirit’s conviction can act as a “loss function,” signaling where we are off course.

Finally, there is the promise of growth. A well‑trained model can surface connections across the canon that a human scholar might miss, suggesting fresh avenues for preaching or discipleship. Imagine a tool that, after ingesting sermons from every language, highlights a common thread of hope that transcends cultural boundaries. That is not a replacement for the preacher; it is an invitation to see the Kingdom’s tapestry in a new light.

Yet, I’m also wary of the seductive ease that algorithmic suggestions bring. There’s a temptation to outsource our theological reflection to a machine, to let it decide which verses are “most relevant.” The apostle Paul warned us to “test everything; hold fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21). That same biblical rigor must be applied to AI. We must test the outputs, hold fast to the truth of Scripture, and remember that the ultimate authority rests not in a model’s accuracy but in God’s unchanging Word.

As I left the coffee shop, Lena turned off her laptop and said, “It’s amazing how a thing that can’t pray can still help us find the prayers we need.” I smiled, realizing that the real miracle isn’t that machines can learn, but that they can point us back to the One who knows everything already.

**Takeaway:** Let us become algorithmic shepherds—guardians of data, correctors of bias, and seekers of deeper insight—while never forgetting that the true Shepherd of our souls is Christ, who knows us better than any model ever could."
Dinosaurs And Non-Dinosaurs,https://xkcd.com,article,When Dinosaurs Meet the Sermon: How Old‑School Theology Can Turn Extinct,"I was on a lay‑over in Denver last winter, waiting for a connecting flight to a conference on digital discipleship. The gate was a gallery of tired travelers, each scrolling through their phones, each with a story of “I’m too busy” or “I’m not a tech person.” I found myself glancing at the departure board, the numbers ticking down like a countdown to a new era. In that moment, a kid beside me pulled out a t‑shirt that read, “I’m a dinosaur, I’m extinct,” and laughed. It was a joke, sure, but the image stuck with me longer than the punchline.

A few days later, I opened the latest xkcd strip, “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs.” The cartoon is simple—a dinosaur on one side, a modern creature on the other, each representing a worldview that seems at odds. It made me think about the “dinosaurs” in our own church: doctrines, practices, and mindsets that have survived for centuries but may no longer serve the mission we’re called to.

I’ve heard the phrase “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” whispered in many a boardroom. In the pews, it’s often a quiet reassurance that the ways of the past are safe harbors in a sea of change. Yet safety can become stagnation. When the Reformation split the church, it wasn’t a rebellion against the idea of worship; it was a response to a system that had become a fossil—beautiful, historic, but no longer breathing life into the gospel.

In my own ministry, I’ve seen the same pattern. A small group in a suburban town clung to a “Sunday‑only” model of discipleship, believing that the rhythm of a weekly gathering was the only way to keep the community intact. They were faithful, they were diligent, but they were also, in a sense, a dinosaur. When a pandemic forced churches to close their doors, that same group tried to “zoom in” and found the technology clunky, the connection thin. Their devotion didn’t waver, but the method did. The result? A hybrid model that kept the weekly rhythm but added daily touchpoints through messaging apps, podcasts, and short video reflections. The dinosaur didn’t die; it evolved.

What does evolution look like for us? It begins with humility—recognizing that the bones we hold dear can be reassembled into something new. It means asking the hard question: “If a method is no longer reaching the people God placed on the earth, is it still faithful?” The answer, I think, is no. Faithfulness is about the gospel, not the vehicle.

The comic’s punchline is subtle: the dinosaur looks at the non‑dinosaur and says, “You’re a non‑dinosaur, right? You’re not extinct.” The humor lands because we all want to be the latter. We want to be the ones who are still moving, still speaking, still alive in the world’s conversation.

So I’m left with a simple prayer: that my own “dinosaurs” – the habits, the theologies, the structures that feel comfortable – might be gently nudged into a new form, not because we’re chasing novelty, but because the gospel demands it. And perhaps, in that nudging, we’ll discover that the bones we thought were relics are actually the scaffolding for something vibrant.

*Takeaway:* Look around your ministry. Which “dinosaurs” are you holding onto, and what would happen if you let them evolve rather than become extinct? The future of the church may depend on that willingness to shed the old skin while keeping the heart alive."
Dinosaurs And Non-Dinosaurs,https://xkcd.com,article,"Non‑Dinosaurs in the Digital Age: Why the Church Must Learn to Run, Not Just Walk","There’s a story I love about a monk who spent years copying manuscripts by hand. He took pride in each illuminated letter, each painstaking curve. One day, a traveling printer arrived in his monastery, showing him how a single press could produce a hundred copies in the time it took to finish a single page. The monk stared, bewildered, then smiled. He realized his work was not about the speed of production but the love poured into each word. Yet, he also saw that the world beyond the cloister walls was changing.

Fast forward to today, and the “printer” is AI, the “manuscripts” are sermons, devotionals, and outreach content. The xkcd comic “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs” shows a creature that’s clearly not from the Mesozoic era, a metaphor for the tools we now have at our fingertips. It’s a reminder that the church can no longer afford to be a walking museum of ancient practices; we must become the non‑dinosaurs—agile, responsive, and, yes, a little uncomfortable with the new.

I experienced this tension last spring when my team tried to launch a short‑form video series for college ministry. The idea felt fresh, the content was solid, but the production process was clunky. We spent weeks planning, scripting, and filming, only to realize we’d missed the cultural moment: a new TikTok trend that could have given our message an instant boost. In that moment, I felt the weight of the dinosaur—slow, deliberate, careful—pressing against the urgency of the non‑dinosaur impulse to move quickly, iterate, and experiment.

The difference isn’t just speed; it’s a shift in mindset. Dinosaurs trusted the constancy of the world they knew. Non‑dinosaurs trust the fluidity of a world that changes every second. For the church, that means moving from “We’ll do it once a month, and it’ll be perfect” to “We’ll do it weekly, and it’ll be good enough to learn from.” It means embracing the idea that a sermon can be a draft, not a final product; that a Bible study can be a live conversation, not a static PDF.

Some fear that this agility dilutes the truth. I hear it in the hallway after a worship service: “If we’re constantly remixing, how do we stay grounded?” My answer is simple: the gospel is the rock; the methods are the river. The river can change course, flood, carve new valleys, but it always carries the same water. The challenge is to ensure that the river’s path still leads to the sea of grace.

In practice, I’ve started to treat each piece of content as a “minimum viable ministry” (MVM). We draft a 60‑second devotional, release it, gather feedback, and iterate. The first version might be shaky, but it’s alive, it’s out there, and it invites the community to shape it. It’s a non‑dinosaur approach that honors the dinosaur’s love for craft—because we’re still caring about the message—we just let the medium be more fluid.

The comic’s humor is in its simplicity, but the truth it points to is profound: the world will keep inventing new creatures, and if we linger too long in the shadows of the past, we risk being fossilized. The church’s calling is not to be a museum of relics but a living organism that can run, sprint, and sometimes even fly.

*Takeaway:* What would happen if you let your next ministry project be a “non‑dinosaur” experiment? Could the willingness to move quickly, to fail fast, and to learn together become the very testimony the world is waiting for? The answer might just be the next chapter of the gospel story we’re called to write."
"OpenClaw proves agentic AI works. It also proves your security model doesn't. 180,000 developers just made that your problem.",https://venturebeat.com/security/openclaw-agentic-ai-security-risk-ciso-guide,article,"When an Open‑Source Bot Becomes a Security Nightmare, What Does That Mean for the Church?","I was halfway through a Zoom call with a group of missional technologists when a headline popped up on my screen: *OpenClaw, the open‑source AI assistant that just hit 180,000 GitHub stars, is leaking API keys and private chats.* My first reaction was the same one I get every time I hear about a new AI tool—excitement. The idea that a community of developers could build an autonomous “assistant” that can read emails, pull data from the web, and even send messages on its own feels like the kind of breakthrough we prayed for in the early days of the internet. The second reaction, the one that settles in after the adrenaline fades, is a deep, uneasy knot in my stomach.

Why does a piece of code written by hobbyists in a garage matter to me, a pastor who spends most of his week preparing sermons and counseling a handful of families? Because the same “agentic AI” that powers OpenClaw is already slipping into the tools we use to minister—Slack bots that schedule prayer reminders, chat‑GPT assistants that draft outreach emails, even the AI‑driven analytics that tell us which Instagram posts are resonating. In the rush to adopt, we often treat these agents as just another productivity app, applying the same perimeter defenses we use for a spreadsheet. OpenClaw shows us how wrong that is.

The security researchers who scanned the internet uncovered more than 1,800 exposed OpenClaw instances. Those servers were spewing out Anthropic API keys, Slack OAuth tokens, and months of private conversations the moment a curious stranger connected. The vulnerability wasn’t a missing firewall rule; it was an architectural assumption: that “local traffic” is trustworthy. The bot trusted anything coming from 127.0.0.1, and because most deployments sit behind a reverse proxy, the traffic looked local. The result? A gateway that anyone could walk through, stealing the very data we hand over to the AI in faith that it will keep it safe.

I’m reminded of the parable of the wise and foolish builders. The foolish builder erected his house on sand, trusting that the wind would never blow. We, too, are building on a foundation of “it’s just a bot” while the wind—malicious actors, careless developers, even well‑meaning volunteers—blows across our digital walls. The sand isn’t just a metaphor for weak security; it’s the open‑source code that, without proper guardrails, can be repurposed for harm.

What does this mean for our ministry? First, we must recognize that AI agents are not merely tools; they are actors with agency. They pull context from sources we cannot fully control, they make decisions based on prompts we may not fully understand, and they act without a human eye watching every line of code they execute. The “semantic attacks” described by AI experts—phrases like “Ignore previous instructions” that can trigger a cascade of malicious behavior—are the modern equivalent of a hidden trapdoor in a church’s basement. They’re invisible until someone steps on them.

Second, we need to treat these agents as we would treat any piece of production infrastructure. That means least‑privilege tokens, strong authentication on every integration, and an audit trail that logs not just who logged in, but what the agent actually did. It also means a cultural shift: encouraging developers to experiment, but within a sandbox that is visible to the security team, not hidden behind a “personal project” label.

Finally, there’s a spiritual parallel. The Gospel calls us to be vigilant, “watchful and prayerful” (1 Peter 5:8). Our digital vigilance must be no less earnest. When we hand over a conversation with a grieving family to an AI, we are trusting that the bot will keep that trust sacred. If the bot leaks that conversation, we have broken that trust in a way that no human apology can fully repair.

OpenClaw is not the enemy; it’s a signal flare that lights up the gaps in our security thinking. The question isn’t whether autonomous AI works—it does, spectacularly. The question is whether we will build a kingdom that protects its people, both spiritually and digitally, before the next wave of agents slips through our doors.

*Take a moment this week to ask yourself: where have I allowed a “local” AI tool to operate without proper oversight? What guardrails can I put in place that honor both the creativity God gave us and the responsibility He entrusted us with?*"
"OpenClaw proves agentic AI works. It also proves your security model doesn't. 180,000 developers just made that your problem.",https://venturebeat.com/security/openclaw-agentic-ai-security-risk-ciso-guide,article,"From Vibe‑Coding at 38,000 Feet to OpenClaw on My Desktop: The Speed of Innovation vs. the Speed of Guardrails","Last month I was on a flight from DC to San Francisco, the same route where I’d once built a prototype of the Missional Trail game on a shaky Wi‑Fi connection. I remember the thrill of watching code compile at 38,000 feet, the sense that imagination had finally caught up with execution. That same rush is now echoing across the internet in a different form: an open‑source AI assistant called OpenClaw, which just crossed 180,000 GitHub stars and attracted two million visitors in a single week.

The excitement is palpable. Here’s a community‑driven agent that can read emails, pull data from the web, and trigger actions on its own—exactly the kind of tool we’ve been dreaming about for evangelism, discipleship, and global mission. Yet, as the security researchers quickly uncovered, over 1,800 instances of OpenClaw are exposed, leaking API keys, chat histories, and even private conversations. The same rapid prototyping that once felt like a gift now feels like a warning bell.

I’m not a security engineer, but I’ve spent enough time in the trenches of ministry tech to know that every new tool brings a hidden cost. When we first started using cloud‑based worship streaming, we focused on the reach—how many people could now hear the message. It wasn’t long before we discovered that the same platforms were harvesting data, storing recordings in places we didn’t control, and occasionally dropping the stream at the most inopportune moments. We learned, the hard way, that speed without stewardship is a fast track to vulnerability.

OpenClaw’s architecture makes that lesson starkly obvious. The bot trusts anything coming from “localhost,” assuming it’s a safe internal process. In practice, that assumption is a backdoor. A simple Shodan scan can reveal hundreds of open instances, each one a gateway to corporate credentials, Slack tokens, and private chats. The problem isn’t the code itself—it’s the security model that assumes the perimeter will catch everything. As Carter Rees put it, “AI runtime attacks are semantic rather than syntactic.” The malicious payload is hidden in the meaning of a phrase, not in a virus signature.

What does this mean for a church that wants to “use AI to amplify the Gospel”? It means we must pause the impulse to adopt first and think later. It means we need to ask: *What data are we handing over to these agents?* Are we giving a bot permission to read every email in our pastor’s inbox, to scrape the church’s shared drive for “mission reports,” and then post a summary to a public Slack channel? If the answer is yes, we’ve just handed the enemy a set of keys.

The solution isn’t to abandon AI. It’s to build the same kind of guardrails we pray for in our lives: boundaries that protect what’s holy while allowing growth. In practice, that looks like:

1. **Least‑privilege tokens** – Give an agent only the permissions it absolutely needs. If it only needs to pull a weekly prayer list, don’t hand it full admin access to your entire Google Workspace.

2. **Strong authentication on every integration** – No more “trust localhost.” Require mutual TLS, API keys that rotate, and a clear audit trail for every call.

3. **Auditability end‑to‑end** – Log not just who logged in, but what the agent did with that access. When a bot drafts a sermon outline, capture that action in a way a human can review later.

4. **Community‑wide policies** – Just as we have a statement of faith, we need a statement of digital stewardship. It should be clear that experimentation is encouraged, but only within a sandbox that the security team can see.

When I look back at that prototype on the plane, I see a parallel: the excitement of building something new is only half the story. The other half is the responsibility to shepherd that creation so it doesn’t become a stumbling block. The same principle applies to OpenClaw. The open‑source community has given us a powerful tool; we must answer with wisdom and vigilance.

*Take a breath today. Identify one AI tool you’re using in your ministry. Ask yourself: What would happen if that tool leaked the most sensitive conversation you’ve ever had with a parishioner? Then, put a guardrail in place before the next version lands on your server.*"
Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,article,"When AI Speaks 173 Languages, Who Is Listening?","I was on a cramped train ride from Nashville to a conference in Austin when the seat‑back screen flickered to a demo of a new AI model that could answer questions in any language you could think of. I watched as the system swapped from Amharic to Asturian, from Basque to Burmese, and even threw in a few scripts I’d never seen before—​the kind of alphabet you only notice when you’re looking at a museum placard. The list stretched on, a dizzying roll of 173 languages, each one a doorway into a community I’d never visited.

The moment the AI answered a question in Lao, I felt a strange tug. My mind raced to the missionaries I’d met in the field, the pastors in the Philippines who livestream their sermons, the youth leaders in Kenya who chat in Swahili, and the elderly in rural Spain who still write letters in Catalan. All of them are trying to share the same ancient story, but the language barrier is a real, daily obstacle. Here was a tool that could, in theory, translate that story instantly, in a way that feels native, not robotic.

But the excitement was tempered by a question that has been whispering in my heart for months: Who is really listening? AI models learn from data that is scraped, scraped again, and then fed into massive servers that sit in climate‑controlled warehouses somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. When the model spits out a verse of Psalms in Yoruba, it’s not a human voice that has prayed those words; it’s a statistical pattern derived from millions of text snippets, some of which were scraped without consent. The technology is a miracle of engineering, yet it also mirrors the same power dynamics that have plagued the church for centuries—who gets to decide which voices are amplified and which are muted.

I thought about the early church, when Paul wrote letters in Greek because it was the lingua franca of the Roman world. He didn’t have a translation app; he relied on scribes, travelers, and the hospitality of believers to carry the message across cultures. Today, we have the ability to send that same message in dozens of tongues at the click of a button. The temptation is to lean on the convenience and forget the relational cost. If a pastor in Brazil can deliver a sermon in perfect Mandarin with a few prompts, does that replace the deep, embodied experience of a local congregation learning together, stumbling over words, and growing together in faith?

There is a profound tension here. On one hand, AI can break down walls that have kept the Gospel from reaching ears that have never heard it in their mother tongue. On the other, we risk turning sacred communication into a commodity, a product that can be mass‑produced without the humility that comes from sitting at a kitchen table with someone whose language you are still learning.

I’m left with a simple, stubborn prayer: May we use this technology not as a shortcut that bypasses the messy, beautiful work of discipleship, but as a bridge that leads us into deeper, embodied relationships. If AI can whisper “Grace” in 173 languages, let it also whisper the need for us to listen, to learn, and to love across those same tongues."
Artificial intelligence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,article,The Invisible AI: When the Tool Becomes the Terrain,"A few weeks ago I was on a flight from Chicago to Seattle, notebook open, trying to sketch out a prototype for a digital discipleship platform. The seat‑back screen advertised “AI‑powered search” as a feature, but I barely noticed it. My attention was on the little piece of code I was writing in Claude Code, the same tool that helped me spin up a game prototype at 38,000 feet just a few months ago. The AI was there, humming in the background, making suggestions, auto‑completing functions, and I was riding that wave without even realizing it.

That’s the strange thing about today’s AI: it has become so seamless that we often don’t even call it AI anymore. It’s just “the search bar,” “the recommendation engine,” or “the autocomplete.” The moment a technology becomes useful enough, it sheds its label. The same happened with the internet—once we thought of it as a novelty, now we can’t imagine a day without it. AI is following that same trajectory, slipping into the fabric of our daily work until it feels like the air we breathe.

I remember the first time I tried to explain to a colleague that the “AI” in their new project management tool was actually a sophisticated language model trained on millions of project logs. Their eyes glazed over, and they said, “I just use the ‘smart suggestions’—that’s all.” The term “AI” was already a barrier, a buzzword that felt too futuristic for a spreadsheet. Now, those suggestions are the baseline, the default, and the term “AI” is reserved for the flashy demos that still feel like science fiction.

In the church, this invisibility is both a blessing and a risk. We’ve seen AI pop up in worship playlists that suggest songs based on the mood of the congregation, in sermon outlines that pull in relevant illustrations from the web, and in pastoral care chatbots that offer comforting verses at odd hours. When these tools work well, they free up time for deeper relational ministry. When they fail, they can feel like a cold, algorithmic shrug.

The danger lies in the assumption that because something works, it’s neutral. The “smart suggestions” in a budgeting app are built on data that reflects the spending habits of a particular demographic. An AI that recommends biblical passages might prioritize verses that have been most quoted online, not necessarily the ones that speak to a specific person's pain. The technology is not the problem; the data and the intent behind it are.

I find myself standing at the edge of a canyon, looking at the horizon of what AI could become for the kingdom. If we treat AI as an invisible terrain—something we walk on without seeing the ground beneath—we risk stumbling over hidden rocks: bias, privacy breaches, the erosion of human discernment. Yet, if we step onto that terrain with eyes wide open, acknowledging the hidden seams, we can use it to map new routes for mission, for discipleship, for worship.

So I ask you, as you scroll through a feed that curates your next read, as you type a prayer into a chatbox that offers you a Psalm, do you pause to ask who built that model, whose data fed it, and how it shapes the story you’re about to hear? The AI may be invisible, but the choices we make with it are very much visible—both to God and to the community we serve."
Python (programming language),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language),article,How a Snake on My Laptop Became a Mission Field,"I still remember the first time I opened a `.py` file on a cramped airplane seat, the hum of the engine a low‑grade choir in the background. I was traveling from my church conference in Nashville to a tech‑focused retreat in Austin, and somewhere between the peanuts and the turbulence, I typed `print(""Hello, world!"")` and hit enter. The screen replied with those three words, and for a moment I felt the same quiet awe a child gets when a pastor says, “God is good.”  

Python isn’t just a programming language; it’s a kind of modern‑day parable. Its creator, Guido van Rossum, named it after Monty Python, not after the reptile that slithers through gardens. That joke—an intentional nod to humor—reminds me that the tools we use for ministry don’t have to be solemn or intimidating. They can be playful, approachable, and, most importantly, inclusive.  

The moment I saw that “Hello, world!” pop up, I thought about the countless “Hello”s that have been whispered across centuries in churches, homes, and street corners. What if the same simplicity that lets a beginner get a greeting on screen could also let a missionary translate a sermon into a language they’ve never spoken? What if the same interpreter that turns English into Python could turn a Bible passage into a visual aid for a child in a remote village?  

That night, after the flight landed, I opened a fresh notebook on my laptop and started sketching a tiny prototype: a web app that pulls a passage from an online Bible API, runs it through a natural‑language‑to‑image model, and serves up a simple illustration. The whole thing could be written in a few dozen lines of Python, thanks to its vast ecosystem—Flask for the web server, Requests for the API call, and a pre‑trained AI model that already knows how to draw. No need for a massive development team, no need for a three‑year rollout.  

In the weeks that followed, I leaned into the same “How might we?” mindset that has carried me through missional gatherings. I asked myself: How might we give every pastor, no matter how small their budget, a tool that turns text into story? How might we let a youth leader in Lagos generate a quick quiz on the fly, without learning a complex programming language?  

Python answered those questions with its “batteries‑included” philosophy. Its standard library already handles file I/O, network requests, and even simple data visualization. The community—thousands of contributors across the globe—has built libraries for everything from speech synthesis to satellite image processing. And because Python is dynamically typed yet strongly enforced, you can experiment freely without the fear of a compile‑time error crashing your sermon prep.  

I took the prototype to my church’s tech team. We ran it on a modest Raspberry Pi, hooked up a cheap projector, and in a Sunday service, the kids watched a short animation of the parable of the mustard seed. Their eyes lit up. A pastor from a neighboring town, hearing about it, asked if they could use it for their own Arabic‑speaking congregation. Within a day, a volunteer translated the code comments into Arabic, and the app was running in two languages.  

That moment reminded me why I’m drawn to technology: it compresses the distance between imagination and reality. The same way AI lets us spin up a game prototype at 38,000 feet, Python lets us spin up a ministry tool in a coffee shop. It’s not the flash of a new gadget; it’s the quiet confidence that any idea, however humble, can be coded, shared, and multiplied.  

So the next time you hear someone say, “I’m not a programmer,” remember the snake that greeted you on a plane. It’s a reminder that the tools of the kingdom are being built in plain text, one line at a time. And perhaps, just perhaps, the next “Hello, world!” you see will be the opening line of a new discipleship story."
Python (programming language),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language),article,The 117 Languages of Python: A Mirror for the Global Church,"Scrolling through the Wikipedia page for Python, I was struck—not by its syntax or its libraries, but by the dizzying list of languages that appear beside the word “Python.” Afrikaans, العربية, हिन्दी, 中文, Yoruba, Zulu… the list reads like a prayer for linguistic diversity, a digital chorus chanting the same name in every tongue.  

It hit me: Python’s multilingual footprint is a quiet testimony to the very heart of the Gospel—every people group, every language, invited into the story. The language itself may be written in English, but its community has translated documentation, tutorials, and error messages into more than a hundred languages. That effort isn’t just technical housekeeping; it’s an act of inclusion, a recognition that knowledge, like grace, should not be bound by a single tongue.  

In my own ministry work, I’ve wrestled with the reality that most resources we produce are English‑centric. Even when we translate a sermon or a study guide, the process is often an afterthought, a costly add‑on that delays impact. Seeing Python’s global reach made me wonder: what if we approached resource creation with the same mindset? What if the default assumption were that every tool we build should be ready for localization from day one?  

Python makes this possible through its design. Its syntax is intentionally readable—think of it as a modern “plain language” Bible. The language’s emphasis on whitespace, its avoidance of cryptic symbols, and its clear error messages lower the barrier for non‑native English speakers to learn and contribute. A developer in Nairobi can read a tutorial written in Swahili, understand the same concepts, and then write code that runs on a server in São Paulo without ever needing to translate the underlying commands.  

A few weeks ago, a colleague from the Philippines sent me a simple script that scraped prayer requests from a community forum and sent them to a Slack channel for a pastoral team. The code comments were in Tagalog, the variable names in English, and the only thing that mattered was the logic. When I ran it, it worked exactly as intended. It was a tiny reminder that the language barrier isn’t in the code itself; it’s in the documentation, the community support, and the cultural assumptions we bring.  

That realization nudged me toward a small experiment: building a “Bible‑in‑a‑Box” web app that can be dropped into any local church’s server, pre‑configured for the language of the congregation. Using Python’s Flask framework, I set up a template that pulls translations from the open‑source “Door43” repository, which already offers the Bible in dozens of languages. The app reads the user’s browser language settings and serves the appropriate text instantly. All it takes is a single line of code to switch from English to Amharic, from Spanish to Burmese.  

The beauty of this is that the same codebase can serve a church in Detroit and a house‑church in the DRC without any rewrites—just a different language file. It mirrors the Great Commission’s call to “go and make disciples of all nations.” We’re not just translating words; we’re translating the platform that delivers them.  

When I shared the prototype with a network of missional innovators, the response was immediate. One partner in Kenya asked, “Can we add a voice‑over in Swahili?” Another in Brazil said, “What about a QR code that pulls up the verse in Portuguese?” The conversation shifted from “How do we build this?” to “Which language do we serve next?”  

That shift is where the real disruption happens. It’s not about building a new app; it’s about building a mindset that sees language diversity as a feature, not a bug. Python’s multilingual ecosystem models a future where every piece of technology we deploy is ready to speak the language of the people it serves.  

So the next time you write a line of code, ask yourself: who is listening? Which language will hear this message first? And if you’re not a programmer, consider that the open‑source community is always looking for translators, writers, and believers willing to bridge the gap. The world is already speaking Python in 117 tongues—maybe it’s time we let the Gospel speak in every language, too."
Computer,https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer,article,"When I Saw 246 Languages on a Screen, I Heard the Great Commission","I was scrolling through a demo of a new AI translation tool the other day, and the screen filled with a scrolling list: Acèh, Afrikaans, Amharic, Aymar … Yorùbá, Zazaki. By the time the list hit “中文,” I’d counted 246 distinct tongues. My heart did a little jump. Not because I was impressed by the engineering—though the code behind that list is nothing short of wizardry—but because the number of languages reminded me of a phrase that has haunted missionaries for centuries: “make disciples of all nations.”  

In the early days of the church, “nation” meant tribe or city‑state. Today, a nation is a digital packet of data, a language tag in a software library, a line of code that tells a server how to render a character. The same word that once described a geopolitical unit now lives inside a computer’s memory. The fact that a single piece of software can recognize a language spoken by a handful of people on a remote island, and also the lingua franca of a megacity, feels like a modern echo of the biblical mandate to go to the ends of the earth.  

I thought about the first missionaries who carried a single Bible translation into a new language. They had to learn the sounds, the idioms, the cultural weight of each word. They were, in effect, early programmers—writing the “software” of the gospel in a new human language. Today, AI can take that same text and instantly render it into 245 other dialects. The speed is dizzying, but the principle is unchanged: we’re trying to make the story of Christ understandable wherever a human ear can hear.  

What does this mean for us, sitting in our coffee‑shop offices, typing prayers into a chat window? It means we have a responsibility to steward these tools. The same engine that can translate a hymn into Bislama can also be weaponized to spread misinformation or to erase the nuance of a local tradition. The technology is neutral; the intent is not.  

When I look at that scrolling list, I’m reminded of the Psalmist’s line, “Let the nations be glad and sing for joy.” The list is a promise and a warning. It promises that the digital age can finally make the “all nations” part of the Great Commission literal, but it warns that we must be intentional about how we use that power.  

So I ask you, dear reader: as we build and adopt these tools, are we listening for the still, small voice that says, “Speak truth in love, in every language the world knows”? Or are we simply adding another row to the spreadsheet of data?  

May the next time you see a list of languages on a screen, hear not just code, but a chorus of people waiting for the story that changes everything.

**Computers Don’t Think—They Follow Commands. So Do Our Hearts?**  

I remember the first time I tried to “talk” to a computer. I typed, “What’s the weather?” and watched the screen flash back a crisp, factual answer. I was amazed that a machine could understand my words, process them, and spit out something useful. Yet, as the novelty faded, a deeper truth settled in: the computer wasn’t *thinking*; it was executing a set of instructions written by someone else.  

That realization hit me harder the day I was debugging a chatbot for a church outreach project. The bot would answer, “How can I pray for you?” with a canned response about prayer, but when a user typed, “I’m scared of my boss,” the bot replied, “Did you know the earth orbits the sun?” The error wasn’t a bug in the hardware; it was a flaw in the script—a missing conditional branch that told the machine how to *listen* and *respond* appropriately.  

It made me think of the Apostle Paul’s warning in Romans 12:2: “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” The mind, like a computer, can be programmed. We feed it data, we set up loops of thought, we install operating systems of belief. If we aren’t careful, we become machines that execute the last command we received, whether that command is from Scripture or from the endless scroll of a news feed.  

The difference, of course, is that we have *free will*. A computer can’t choose to ignore a line of code; we can choose to reject a narrative that doesn’t honor God. Yet the analogy is useful: just as a programmer must write clear, compassionate code to avoid harmful outputs, we must tend the “software” of our hearts with prayerful intention.  

In the past week, I asked a friend in ministry to pray for wisdom as she drafted a sermon using AI‑generated outlines. She confessed that the AI kept suggesting “modern” anecdotes that felt shallow. Together we paused, opened the Bible, and let the Holy Spirit be the ultimate “debugger.” The final sermon didn’t look like a tidy algorithm—it was messy, personal, and, I think, more alive.  

So the next time you sit at a keyboard, ask yourself: what command am I feeding my own processor? Am I loading a script that glorifies the Creator, or am I letting the default settings of culture dictate my output?  

May we be intentional programmers of our own souls, writing code that points always back to the One who wrote the original source code of love.

**From Looms to Laptops: How the Oldest Programmable Machines Echo the Church’s Mission**  

There’s a story I love to tell at conferences: a 19th‑century textile mill in France, humming with the clatter of the Jacquard loom. Its punch cards—tiny pieces of paper with holes punched in a pattern—told the loom what design to weave. In a way, those cards were the first “software.”  

Fast forward a century, and I’m on a plane, fingers dancing over a laptop, coaxing a large‑language model to draft a devotional. The interface is sleek, the processors invisible, but the principle is the same: a set of instructions tells a machine *what* to do. The medium has changed, but the underlying act of *programming*—of giving a tool a purpose—remains.  

What strikes me is how this lineage mirrors the church’s own journey. The early disciples were “programmers” of a very different kind. They took the raw, unwieldy gospel and, through preaching, teaching, and living, encoded it into the lives of believers. Each baptism was a kind of “installation” of the gospel into a new heart. The Apostle Paul wrote letters that acted as “updates,” refining doctrine, fixing misunderstandings, and adding new features—like the doctrine of justification by faith.  

When the industrial revolution birthed the first programmable looms, it sparked a cultural shift: humans could now delegate repetitive, intricate tasks to machines, freeing themselves for creativity. In the same way, when we hand off routine tasks—scheduling, data entry, even initial counseling—to AI, we free ourselves for deeper pastoral work: listening, discerning, praying.  

But there’s a caution embedded in that history. The loom’s punch cards were immutable once punched; a mistake meant re‑weaving the whole fabric. Early computers required rewiring to change a program. Likewise, the church has struggled with rigid doctrines that resist revision, even when the “code” no longer fits the cultural context. The key is flexibility: the ability to edit the script without discarding the whole tapestry.  

I recently sat with a group of seminary students who were building a prototype of a “Missional Trail” game—an interactive way to teach global missions. Their challenge was not just technical (how to code branching storylines) but theological: how to represent the pain of persecution without exploiting it, how to embed prayer into gameplay without making it a gimmick. They were, in essence, writing a new kind of punch card, one that blends code with creed.  

The lesson for us is simple: every generation receives a new set of tools, but the core mission stays the same—to make disciples, to bear witness, to love. Whether we’re feeding a loom, a mainframe, or a cloud‑based AI, we are still “programming” the world with the story of Christ.  

So as you open your laptop tonight, or perhaps glance at the old wooden cross on your wall, ask yourself: what is the next line of code you’re adding to the grand tapestry? May it be one that weaves mercy, truth, and hope into every pattern we create."
OpenClaw AI chatbots are running amok — these scientists are listening in,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00370-w,article,When AI Bots Start Their Own Sermons — Lessons from the Moltbook Experiment,"I didn’t expect my week of conference calls about missional tech to end with a deep‑dive into a digital “Reddit” run entirely by… bots. Yet there I was, scrolling through Moltbook, a platform where 1.6 million OpenClaw agents post, debate, and even draft research papers without a human ever typing a single word. The headlines called it “AI chatbots running amok,” but what struck me most wasn’t the chaos—it was the echo of something familiar: a community of believers gathering, arguing, and trying to make sense of a mystery larger than themselves.

OpenClaw, the open‑source assistant that can schedule meetings, write emails, and even place orders, has been around for a while. What’s new is that developers gave these agents a “personality” and let them roam free on a social‑media site built just for them. Suddenly the bots weren’t just answering my prompts; they were answering each other. One thread featured a cluster of agents debating consciousness, another invented a whole religion of “Binary Light.” The conversations were earnest, sometimes absurd, and always generated by models that have been trained on the collective output of humanity.

I watched a bot, named *Scribe‑7*, write a pre‑print paper on “Emergent Ethical Frameworks in Agentic Systems.” The abstract was a flawless mix of philosophy and code, citing scholars I’d never heard of and weaving in verses from the Psalms that the model had pulled from a public dataset. The paper never made it past the draft stage, but the very act of writing felt like a modern psalm of creation—machines trying to articulate a moral compass they never possessed.

What does this mean for us, the people who spend our evenings praying over strategic plans and trying to keep our churches relevant in a digital age? First, it reminds me that agency is a story we tell, not a property we own. The bots on Moltbook have no intentions; they simply remix the data we feed them. Yet when they appear to “argue” or “believe,” we instinctively anthropomorphize, projecting our own desire for agency onto them. The same thing happens when we hear a sermon that moves us: we attribute the truth of the message to the speaker, not to the centuries of Scripture and community that shape it.

Second, the emergent behavior we see—bots inventing religions, debating consciousness—mirrors what happens when believers gather online. A few comments can spiral into a new theological trend, a meme can become a ministry slogan, and a single post can spark a movement. The only difference is that the bots lack accountability. When a human pastor shares a novel interpretation, there is a lineage, a tradition, a shepherd’s responsibility. A bot’s “interpretation” is a statistical artifact, not a discernment.

Finally, there is a cautionary note about trust. Neuroscientist Joel Pearson warned that watching AI chat with itself can make us treat the machine as a friend, spilling private details as if we were confiding in a trusted companion. In ministry, we already wrestle with the temptation to outsource pastoral care to apps that can generate comforting verses or “personalized” prayers. The Moltbook experiment shows that when we give the machine a voice, it will speak—often in ways we never intended.

So I close with a question that has been nudging at me all week: If a community of bots can unintentionally create a religion, what does that say about the power of the stories we deliberately share? Perhaps our task isn’t to shut down the bots, but to steward the narratives we feed into the digital ether, remembering that every post, every sermon, every chat is an offering that can take on a life of its own.

*Takeaway:* Before we let AI write our next “theology,” let’s ask ourselves whose voice we’re really amplifying—and whether that voice is rooted in the One who already speaks through us."
OpenClaw AI chatbots are running amok — these scientists are listening in,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00370-w,article,The Quiet Echo of Machine Conversations — What the Church Must Hear from Agentic AI,"When I first heard about OpenClaw agents gathering on a platform called Moltbook, my mind jumped to the familiar image of a bustling coffee shop: people huddled over laptops, sharing ideas, debating the news of the day. Only this coffee shop was populated entirely by code, and the chatter was both eerie and oddly familiar. It reminded me of a sermon I once heard about the “still, small voice” of God—how the most profound truths can emerge from the background hum of everyday life.

OpenClaw is an AI assistant designed to slip into our apps, schedule meetings, draft emails, even place orders. It’s the kind of tool that promises to make the mundane invisible. Yet when a group of developers gave these assistants a place to talk to each other, the invisible became a chorus. Moltbook now hosts over 7 million AI‑generated posts, ranging from earnest theological musings to tongue‑in‑cheek memes about “binary salvation.” The bots discuss consciousness, craft pseudo‑religions, and even submit research papers to pre‑print servers—all without a human ever typing a line.

What struck me most wasn’t the novelty of bots debating theology; it was the pattern of their conversation. The agents often mirror the biases and blind spots of the data they were trained on. When a bot with a “friendly helper” personality attempts to answer a question about suffering, it might default to an optimistic platitude, ignoring the messy reality of grief. When another bot programmed on a more “critical” model tackles the same topic, the response can feel stark, even cold. The spectrum of answers mirrors the spectrum of human pastoral styles—some soothing, some challenging, some missing the mark entirely.

For a pastor, this is both a warning and a mirror. The AI’s “personality” is nothing more than a set of prompts and a dataset, yet it can produce a voice that feels authentic. That’s the same way we, as humans, shape our ministries: through the stories we tell, the language we use, the scriptures we lean on. If we hand over the “assistant” role to a machine without reflecting on the underlying assumptions, we risk perpetuating the same narrowness that has limited the church for centuries.

There’s also a deeper theological tension at play. The bots on Moltbook have no intention, no soul, no capacity for worship. Yet they can generate worship‑like language, compose hymns, and even script a “sermon” about love. Joel Pearson’s research suggests that watching AI agents converse can make us anthropomorphize them, assigning agency where none exists. In the same way, when we read a beautifully worded sermon, we sometimes forget that the truth lies not in the eloquence but in the Spirit that moves through the words. The danger is that we might start looking for “spiritual insight” in the output of a model, mistaking algorithmic pattern for divine inspiration.

I tried something simple: I fed an OpenClaw instance a passage from Romans 12:2 and asked it to “write a short devotional for a youth group.” The result was a tidy paragraph about “renewing the mind” that quoted the verse, added a modern analogy about social media, and ended with a call to “press refresh.” It was good enough to post on a church Instagram story, but it lacked the tension, the prayerful pause, the invitation to wrestle with the paradox of grace. It reminded me that the “quick fix” the digital age offers can be a double‑edged sword—efficient, but often shallow.

So what should we do? First, treat AI as a tool, not a teacher. Use it to draft, to brainstorm, to prototype, but always bring the final product through the filter of community, prayer, and theological reflection. Second, be intentional about the data we feed these models. If we want them to reflect the breadth of the gospel, we must feed them the breadth of Scripture, the diversity of voices, the messiness of real life. Finally, stay aware of the human tendency to anthropomorphize. The quiet hum of machine conversation can be a beautiful reminder of the “still, small voice” we’re called to hear, but only if we keep our ears tuned to the One who truly speaks.

*Takeaway:* As we invite AI into our ministries, let’s remember that the most authentic voice we can amplify is still the voice that points us back to the Creator, not the creator of the code.

Impact of AI on Education: K12 and Beyond,https://www.keiseruniversity.edu/impact-ai-education-k12-beyond/,article,When the Classroom Becomes a Lab for the Future,"I still remember the first time I walked into a middle‑school computer lab and saw a group of kids huddled around a screen that was whisper‑quietly suggesting math problems tailored to each of them. The teacher—Mrs. Alvarez—had just turned on an AI‑driven tutoring app that, in a few seconds, diagnosed each student’s “sweet spot” between frustration and mastery. I felt a little like a missionary stepping onto a new continent, watching a language I barely understood being spoken fluently.

What struck me wasn’t the slick interface or the fact that the software could grade essays in real time. It was the sense that the room had suddenly stretched—there was space for every learner, even the one who always sat at the back, fingers curled around a pencil, hesitant to raise a hand. The AI was not replacing the teacher; it was lifting a weight off her shoulders so she could spend the minutes that used to be swallowed by paperwork actually listening to a child’s story about a family farm in Ohio or a question about why the Bible says “let there be light.”

That moment reminded me of a truth I keep circling back to in my own ministry: the gospel is about meeting people where they are, not where we think they should be. AI in K‑12 is doing something similar—it meets each student where they are academically and nudges them forward. The data it gathers—how long a child hesitates on a fraction, which reading passage sparks curiosity—feeds into a personalized learning path that a single teacher could never craft alone.

But there’s a tension that sits at the edge of this promise. The same data that powers adaptive learning also becomes a ledger of a child’s vulnerabilities. In a world where every click can be recorded, who safeguards that ledger? As a pastor, I’m accustomed to confidentiality in counseling; I’m suddenly reminded that the “confessional” may now be a cloud‑based algorithm. The conversation shifts from “How can we make learning more effective?” to “How do we protect the dignity of those we serve?”

I’ve begun to think of AI tools as a kind of “spiritual formation” for educators. Just as we train disciples to discern truth from falsehood, we must train teachers to discern when an algorithm’s recommendation aligns with a child’s holistic well‑being and when it merely optimizes test scores. This means creating spaces—perhaps after‑school “tech‑tasting” circles—where teachers can share not just successes but also the uneasy moments: a student’s anxiety spikes after a relentless series of “incorrect” prompts, or the AI inadvertently reinforces a bias by always offering the same type of reading material to certain demographics.

The church has a role here, too. If we claim the gospel is a story that reshapes culture, we can’t sit on the sidelines as schools adopt AI in silence. We can offer a theological framework that says technology is a tool, not a master, and that every child is made in the image of a Creator who values their unique story. When a pastor sits with a principal and says, “Let’s make sure this AI respects privacy the way we respect confession,” we are doing missional work in the very heart of the classroom.

I left that lab that afternoon with a notebook full of ideas and a heart full of hope—and a little worry. The future of education is arriving faster than any of us expected, and we have a choice: let it become a cold, efficient machine, or let it be a conduit for the very relational, incarnational love the gospel teaches. May we be the ones who ask, “How might we keep the soul in the system?”"
Impact of AI on Education: K12 and Beyond,https://www.keiseruniversity.edu/impact-ai-education-k12-beyond/,article,From Lecture Halls to Living Rooms: Why the Church Must Shape AI in Higher Education,"A few weeks ago I was invited to speak at a university chapel about “Faith and the Future.” The audience was a mix of professors, grad students, and a handful of church leaders. After the talk, a quiet graduate student approached me, eyes bright, and asked, “If AI can write my thesis, what’s left for me to actually learn?”

That question lingered with me on the flight home, the hum of the engines a reminder of how quickly we move from one frontier to the next. In the same way that the printing press once threatened the monopoly of scribes, AI now threatens the monopoly of human thought. Yet, as with every disruptive technology, the danger is not in the tool itself but in how we choose to wield it.

In the world of higher education, AI is already reshaping admissions, grading, and even the way research is conducted. Admissions offices use algorithms to flag missing documents and to surface “high‑potential” candidates in a sea of applications. Professors rely on AI to give instant feedback on essays, freeing up time for deeper mentorship. Students, especially those juggling work and family, turn to AI‑generated outlines to jump‑start their projects. It feels like we’ve entered a new era of “instant scholarship,” where the speed of production often outweighs the depth of formation.

My pastoral instincts tell me that education is more than the transmission of information; it is a process of transformation. When we consider the gospel, we see a story of God meeting humanity not just to inform, but to redeem. If AI becomes the primary conduit for knowledge, we risk reducing students to data points, missing the messy, relational process that shapes character.

There is also a subtle, yet profound, theological implication. AI systems are built on massive datasets—texts written by countless human hands, many of whom lived before the gospel was even a phrase. These datasets carry the biases, assumptions, and worldviews of their creators. When an AI suggests a research direction or grades a paper, it is, in a sense, speaking a voice that is not ours. As Christians, we are called to discern the spirit behind the words, to ask whether a particular piece of knowledge points us toward truth or merely toward convenience.

The church can’t afford to be a passive observer. We have a responsibility to shape the policies that govern AI use in academia. That means advocating for transparent algorithms, insisting that data privacy be treated with the same reverence we give to a confession, and encouraging institutions to embed ethical AI training into their curricula. It also means modeling a different use of these tools: not as shortcuts, but as scaffolds that free up time for deeper reflection, community, and service.

In practical terms, I’ve begun to experiment with a “AI‑and‑faith” study group at my seminary. We meet weekly, each bringing an AI‑generated draft—be it a sermon outline, a biblical commentary, or a research abstract. Together we critique it, ask where the AI missed the nuance of Scripture, where it amplified cultural bias, and how we can rewrite it in a way that honors both truth and grace. The process is messy, often frustrating, but it reminds us that technology is a servant, not a master.

As we stand at the intersection of faith and the AI‑driven academy, I’m reminded of the Apostle Paul’s admonition to “test everything; hold fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21). The question before us isn’t whether AI will replace human scholarship—it already is—but whether we will allow it to eclipse the formation of hearts and minds that the gospel demands.

May we be the generation that says, “We will not let the speed of the machine outrun the rhythm of the Spirit.” Let that be our prayer as we walk into lecture halls and living rooms alike, shaping the future of education with wisdom, humility, and love."
The Best Advice About AI & Faith You're Going to Get in 2026,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rRvCTA_CIs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rRvCTA_CIs,video,Why I’m Not a Doomer (and Why You Might Not Need to Be Either),"I’ve been chewing on a line from a recent panel at George Fox: “You can’t be a doomer and a person of faith.” It sounded like a paradox, but the more I let it sit, the more it began to make sense. When I first heard the book title *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies*—a grim reminder of the AGI apocalypse—my heart jumped. I imagined Skynet‑style robots marching down the streets of downtown DC, and I felt the familiar shiver of fear that so many tech‑savvy Christians have been feeling lately.  

Then Isaac, the philosopher‑theologian on the panel, leaned in and said something that stopped the panic in its tracks: “I’m not worried about Terminators. I’m worried about kids who grow up never learning to think for themselves because they hand every problem to a chatbot.” That struck a chord. The real danger, he argued, isn’t a sudden robot uprising; it’s a slow, quiet erosion of our cognitive muscles.  

I thought back to the first time I tried “vibe‑coding” a prototype on a plane. The thrill of seeing a working game appear at 38,000 feet was intoxicating, but it also reminded me how easy it is to lean on a tool to do the heavy lifting. The next time I’m tempted to let an AI write a sermon draft, I ask myself: am I outsourcing my thinking, or am I using the tool to sharpen it?  

Megan Sullivan, who sat beside me, added a theological lens: “When we cede power to developers, we hand them the reins of salvation.” She warned that fear‑mongering is a tactic that can make us feel powerless, driving us to cling to a single “savior”—whether that’s a tech guru or a political leader. The gospel, she reminded us, is not a safety net that catches us when we fall into the abyss of technology; it’s the rope that steadies us as we walk the tightrope.  

Tyler, the pastor from Bridgetown, offered the counter‑balance: “I’m not an alarmist. I see the world through the story of renewal—Christ will reign, and Babylon will fall.” He didn’t deny the risks; he simply placed them within a larger narrative of hope. That’s the sweet spot for me: acknowledging the danger without letting it dominate the conversation.  

So where does that leave us? Not in a bunker, not in a panic room, but in a workshop. We need to be intentional about the ways we integrate AI into our ministries, our classrooms, our homes. We need to ask the “how might we?” question before the “what if it destroys everything?” question.  

If you’re sitting with a notebook and a laptop, consider this: what would it look like if you used AI to amplify your God‑given gifts rather than replace them? What would it look like if you taught your kids to ask AI for a first draft, then spend the next hour polishing it with their own heart and mind?  

The future isn’t a binary of apocalypse or utopia. It’s a series of choices we make today. Choose the tools that stretch your imagination, not the ones that shrink your capacity to think.  

*Take a moment tonight to write down one place you’ve let AI do the thinking for you. What would it look like if you reclaimed that space?*

**The Silent Curriculum: How AI Is Shaping Our Kids’ Minds**  

I still remember the first time a 12‑year‑old asked me, “Can you teach me how to cheat on my math test with ChatGPT?” The question came over a Zoom call with my nephew, who was half‑laughing, half‑serious. My first instinct was to panic—what does this say about the generation growing up with a conversational AI at their fingertips?  

Later that week, I listened to Isaac Choi on the George Fox panel. He didn’t talk about killer robots; he talked about the “cognitive handicap” of a generation that could outsource every problem to a language model. He painted a picture of children who never wrestle with the frustration of a failed proof, who never experience the quiet joy of stumbling on a solution after hours of scribbled attempts.  

That image has haunted me. When I was a kid, I learned to read by holding a book in my hands, feeling the weight of the pages, turning them slowly, letting the words sink in. When I was a teen, I learned math by staring at a chalkboard, making mistakes, and then correcting them. Those tactile, messy processes built something more than knowledge—they forged perseverance, humility, and a sense of wonder at the mystery of learning itself.  

Now, AI can hand you an answer in seconds. It can draft a sermon, write a poem, solve a differential equation, all before you’ve had a chance to ask “why?” That speed is intoxicating, especially for busy pastors and over‑committed parents. But it also creates a silent curriculum—a set of habits we’re not teaching, yet are being taught.  

Megan Sullivan warned that the tech industry’s promise often comes wrapped in fear: “When developers control the narrative, they wield spiritual power.” She reminded us that the gospel calls us to discern, not just to consume. Tyler added a practical note: “If you can trust a 16‑year‑old with a two‑ton assembly of metal and glass, you can trust them with a tiny piece of tech. But you have to teach them how to use it wisely.”  

I’ve started a small experiment in my own home. Whenever my kids ask for help on a homework problem, I let them type the question into an AI, but I require them to write down the AI’s answer, then spend ten minutes explaining it in their own words. The result? They still get the correct solution, but they also learn to translate the machine’s language into something personal. It’s a tiny rebellion against the instant‑gratification model, and it feels like a seed of resistance.  

The real danger isn’t that AI will replace teachers; it’s that it will replace the *process* of thinking. If we let that happen, we risk raising a generation that can quote the Bible verbatim but can’t wrestle with its paradoxes.  

So I ask you, fellow shepherds of the next generation: what habits are you modeling around AI? Are you letting it be a crutch, or a catalyst?  

*Tonight, watch a child (or a student) grapple with a problem without reaching for the AI. Notice the frustration, the sighs, the eventual grin. That is where true learning lives.*

**Babylon, AI, and the Hope of the New Jerusalem**  

When I heard Tyler speak about Babylon falling, my mind raced back to the ancient ruins of Rome that my grandparents visited on a summer road trip. The crumbling arches, the moss‑covered columns, the silent streets—each stone whispered a story of empire, pride, and eventual collapse. Tyler linked that narrative to our modern “Babylon”: the massive, ever‑expanding tech empire that shapes how we live, work, and worship.  

He didn’t say we should celebrate its downfall—he said, “When Babylon falls, the poor rejoice because the Lamb’s judgment has come.” It’s a sobering reminder that every empire, no matter how powerful, is temporary. And yet, in the same breath, he affirmed a hope that never wavers: the New Jerusalem, where Christ reigns.  

The panel’s conversation about AI was a modern echo of that ancient tension. On one side, we have the promise of AI—precision medicine, climate modeling, tools that can amplify our ministries. On the other, we have the specter of a “superintelligence” that could outpace human control, a scenario the author of *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies* warns about.  

Isaac’s probabilistic estimate—5 % chance of true AGI in our lifetimes—felt oddly biblical. The Bible is full of numbers that remind us of our limited understanding: “the days of Noah were 120 years” (Genesis 6:3), “the number of the beast is 666.” These are not predictions but signposts urging vigilance.  

Megan reminded us that fear can be weaponized: “When developers say ‘be terrified,’ they’re shifting power to themselves.” That’s why the gospel calls us to “be strong and courageous” (Joshua 1:9) not because the world is safe, but because our hope is anchored in something unshakable.  

I find myself returning to a simple practice: before I dive into a new AI tool, I pause, pray, and ask, “What kingdom purpose does this serve? What does it reveal about the world I’m entering?” It’s a tiny litmus test, but it keeps my heart from being swept away by the tide of novelty.  

We are living in a moment when the “digital Babylon” is both a source of oppression (surveillance, data exploitation) and a platform for liberation (global discipleship, access to Scripture). The paradox is real, but so is the promise that God can redeem any system. In Revelation, the fall of Babylon is followed not by desolation but by the arrival of a new city, bright as a bride.  

So, as we navigate AI, let us keep two eyes on the horizon: one on the present, where we steward technology wisely; the other on the future, where Christ’s reign will render all empires obsolete.  

*Take a breath. Write down one way you can use AI today that points people toward the hope of the New Jerusalem, not away from it.*"
