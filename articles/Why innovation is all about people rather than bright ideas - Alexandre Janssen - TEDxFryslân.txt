**The Bright Idea Myth — Why God Gives Us People, Not Just Plans**

When I boarded a flight from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco last spring, I stared out the window at the endless sky and thought about the tiny device in my pocket. That little slab of glass holds more communication power than President Kennedy ever imagined. It’s a reminder that technology is not just moving faster; it’s reshaping the very rhythm of how we live, work, and worship.

A few months later, a colleague in Kentucky texted me a simple question: “Can we build a game that teaches people about global missions?” My first instinct was to ask, “How might we?” I didn’t have a polished plan, but I did have a prototype on my laptop by the time we landed. The point isn’t that the idea was brilliant; it was that the people around me were willing to try, to fail, and to iterate at 38,000 feet.

That experience mirrors what Alexandre Janssen said in his TEDx talk: innovation isn’t about a flash of brilliance. It’s about the people who are willing to turn that flash into a flame. In the corporate world, CEOs love to tout “innovation” as a strategic priority. Yet a study Janssen cited shows only a fifth actually put it on the agenda. The rest are caught in a paradox: they love the word but fear the mess that comes with true change.

The corporate “immune system” is a perfect illustration. When an accountant named Rob—who spent a decade balancing ledgers—heard his wife rave about a medical‑dosage app, he didn’t dismiss it because it was outside his job description. He asked, “How do we know it’s trustworthy?” That question was the spark. When he pitched the idea to his bosses, the corporate antibodies attacked. “We’re accountants, not app developers,” they said.

Instead of crushing Rob’s curiosity, the innovation team gave him a seat at a new table. We didn’t hire him for his résumé; we hired him for his passion. Within a year, Rob was speaking at health conferences, leading a product team, and opening a market we never knew existed. The idea didn’t change us; the person did.

As a Christian, I see a parallel in the body of Christ. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 12 that we are many parts, each with its own function. The church’s “innovation” isn’t a new worship style or a slick app; it’s the ordinary people—teachers, baristas, retirees—who feel God moving them to serve in unexpected ways. When we cling to the familiar, we build an immune system that attacks the new. When we give space for God‑gifts to flourish, we become a living laboratory of grace.

So how do we cultivate that kind of environment? Janssen offers three simple, yet radical, conditions:

1. **Hire (or invite) for passion, not just skill.** A résumé is a rear‑view mirror; a heart’s desire points forward.  
2. **Create safety.** If people fear corporate antibodies, they’ll never risk the unknown.  
3. **Give an “I f***ed up” card.** Let them fail openly, and as leaders, take responsibility for the fallout.

Imagine a church that hands out such cards at the end of a leadership retreat. A youth pastor could test a new digital discipleship platform without fearing budget cuts. A small‑group leader could experiment with a justice‑oriented service project, knowing that if it flops, the leadership will stand with them. The result? A community that moves at the speed of the smartphone, not the printing press.

The world is accelerating. Adoption cycles that once took half a century now shrink to six years. If we want the Gospel to keep pace, we must stop worshipping bright ideas and start worshipping the people God places in our midst.  

**Takeaway:** Look around your table—who is holding a bright idea, and who is holding the courage to act on it? Invite them in, protect them, and hand them an “I f***ed up” card. The next breakthrough may not be a product; it may be the person God has been shaping for this very moment.

**The “I F**

*ed Up” Card: Grace for Failure in a Fast‑Moving World**

I remember the first time I heard about the “I f***ed up” card. It sounded like a joke—an irreverent way to admit mistakes. But as I listened to Alexandre Janssen describe it, the card felt like a tangible expression of something the church has been preaching for millennia: grace.

The card works like this: an employee (or volunteer) receives a card that says, “If you don’t use this card within a year, you’re let go.” The point isn’t to threaten; it’s to create a safe space for daring experiments. If the experiment fails, the leader takes responsibility. In a culture that punishes error, this flips the script. It says, “We trust you enough to let you stumble, and we’ll bear the cost of that stumble.”

When I think of the early church, I see a community that was constantly trying new ways to live out the Gospel—house churches, secret gatherings, breaking bread in the catacombs. They faced persecution, yet they kept experimenting because they believed the Spirit was larger than any human failure. The “I f***ed up” card is a modern‑day embodiment of that same confidence.

In my own ministry, I’ve seen the consequences of a “no‑failure” mindset. A small‑group leader once told me she stopped inviting newcomers because the first few times the conversation fell flat, the board whispered, “Maybe we’re not ready.” The fear of failure turned a vibrant community into a stagnant echo chamber. When we stopped measuring everything by immediate ROI, we opened the door for authentic, messy, missional work.

Janssen’s story of Rob, the accountant turned health‑tech pioneer, illustrates the power of this grace. Rob wasn’t hired for his technical prowess; he was hired for his curiosity. The organization gave him a safe environment and an implicit “I f***ed up” card—if his venture didn’t pan out, they’d still value his contribution. He went on to lead a new market, and the company gained a fresh avenue for impact.

What would that look like in a church setting? Imagine a worship team that wants to experiment with a virtual reality prayer experience. Traditionally, the budget committee would say, “We can’t afford a failure.” With an “I f***ed up” card, the team could prototype, test, and if it doesn’t resonate, the leadership absorbs the cost and learns. The congregation sees a community that is willing to try, to stumble, and to rise again—mirroring the resurrection narrative itself.

There’s a tension, of course. We can’t hand out cards recklessly. The card is a covenant: we promise safety, and we expect stewardship of resources. It forces leaders to ask, “What am I willing to risk for the Kingdom?” and “What would it look like if we trusted the people God has placed here?”

The pandemic taught us that speed matters. Churches moved services online within weeks, not months. Ministries pivoted to meet people where they were—on Zoom, on Instagram, in drive‑throughs. Those who survived were the ones that gave their people the room to fail fast and iterate faster. The “I f***ed up” card is a concrete way to codify that agility.

**Reflection:** If you were handed an “I f***ed up” card today, who would you give it to? What bold experiment would you ask them to try, trusting that even a failure would be a step forward for the body of Christ? Let that question sit with you this week, and consider how grace for failure might become the most innovative practice in your community.
