**When Dinosaurs Meet the Sermon: How Old‑School Theology Can Turn Extinct**

I was on a lay‑over in Denver last winter, waiting for a connecting flight to a conference on digital discipleship. The gate was a gallery of tired travelers, each scrolling through their phones, each with a story of “I’m too busy” or “I’m not a tech person.” I found myself glancing at the departure board, the numbers ticking down like a countdown to a new era. In that moment, a kid beside me pulled out a t‑shirt that read, “I’m a dinosaur, I’m extinct,” and laughed. It was a joke, sure, but the image stuck with me longer than the punchline.

A few days later, I opened the latest xkcd strip, “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs.” The cartoon is simple—a dinosaur on one side, a modern creature on the other, each representing a worldview that seems at odds. It made me think about the “dinosaurs” in our own church: doctrines, practices, and mindsets that have survived for centuries but may no longer serve the mission we’re called to.

I’ve heard the phrase “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” whispered in many a boardroom. In the pews, it’s often a quiet reassurance that the ways of the past are safe harbors in a sea of change. Yet safety can become stagnation. When the Reformation split the church, it wasn’t a rebellion against the idea of worship; it was a response to a system that had become a fossil—beautiful, historic, but no longer breathing life into the gospel.

In my own ministry, I’ve seen the same pattern. A small group in a suburban town clung to a “Sunday‑only” model of discipleship, believing that the rhythm of a weekly gathering was the only way to keep the community intact. They were faithful, they were diligent, but they were also, in a sense, a dinosaur. When a pandemic forced churches to close their doors, that same group tried to “zoom in” and found the technology clunky, the connection thin. Their devotion didn’t waver, but the method did. The result? A hybrid model that kept the weekly rhythm but added daily touchpoints through messaging apps, podcasts, and short video reflections. The dinosaur didn’t die; it evolved.

What does evolution look like for us? It begins with humility—recognizing that the bones we hold dear can be reassembled into something new. It means asking the hard question: “If a method is no longer reaching the people God placed on the earth, is it still faithful?” The answer, I think, is no. Faithfulness is about the gospel, not the vehicle.

The comic’s punchline is subtle: the dinosaur looks at the non‑dinosaur and says, “You’re a non‑dinosaur, right? You’re not extinct.” The humor lands because we all want to be the latter. We want to be the ones who are still moving, still speaking, still alive in the world’s conversation.

So I’m left with a simple prayer: that my own “dinosaurs” – the habits, the theologies, the structures that feel comfortable – might be gently nudged into a new form, not because we’re chasing novelty, but because the gospel demands it. And perhaps, in that nudging, we’ll discover that the bones we thought were relics are actually the scaffolding for something vibrant.

*Takeaway:* Look around your ministry. Which “dinosaurs” are you holding onto, and what would happen if you let them evolve rather than become extinct? The future of the church may depend on that willingness to shed the old skin while keeping the heart alive.

**Non‑Dinosaurs in the Digital Age: Why the Church Must Learn to Run, Not Just Walk**

There’s a story I love about a monk who spent years copying manuscripts by hand. He took pride in each illuminated letter, each painstaking curve. One day, a traveling printer arrived in his monastery, showing him how a single press could produce a hundred copies in the time it took to finish a single page. The monk stared, bewildered, then smiled. He realized his work was not about the speed of production but the love poured into each word. Yet, he also saw that the world beyond the cloister walls was changing.

Fast forward to today, and the “printer” is AI, the “manuscripts” are sermons, devotionals, and outreach content. The xkcd comic “Dinosaurs and Non‑Dinosaurs” shows a creature that’s clearly not from the Mesozoic era, a metaphor for the tools we now have at our fingertips. It’s a reminder that the church can no longer afford to be a walking museum of ancient practices; we must become the non‑dinosaurs—agile, responsive, and, yes, a little uncomfortable with the new.

I experienced this tension last spring when my team tried to launch a short‑form video series for college ministry. The idea felt fresh, the content was solid, but the production process was clunky. We spent weeks planning, scripting, and filming, only to realize we’d missed the cultural moment: a new TikTok trend that could have given our message an instant boost. In that moment, I felt the weight of the dinosaur—slow, deliberate, careful—pressing against the urgency of the non‑dinosaur impulse to move quickly, iterate, and experiment.

The difference isn’t just speed; it’s a shift in mindset. Dinosaurs trusted the constancy of the world they knew. Non‑dinosaurs trust the fluidity of a world that changes every second. For the church, that means moving from “We’ll do it once a month, and it’ll be perfect” to “We’ll do it weekly, and it’ll be good enough to learn from.” It means embracing the idea that a sermon can be a draft, not a final product; that a Bible study can be a live conversation, not a static PDF.

Some fear that this agility dilutes the truth. I hear it in the hallway after a worship service: “If we’re constantly remixing, how do we stay grounded?” My answer is simple: the gospel is the rock; the methods are the river. The river can change course, flood, carve new valleys, but it always carries the same water. The challenge is to ensure that the river’s path still leads to the sea of grace.

In practice, I’ve started to treat each piece of content as a “minimum viable ministry” (MVM). We draft a 60‑second devotional, release it, gather feedback, and iterate. The first version might be shaky, but it’s alive, it’s out there, and it invites the community to shape it. It’s a non‑dinosaur approach that honors the dinosaur’s love for craft—because we’re still caring about the message—we just let the medium be more fluid.

The comic’s humor is in its simplicity, but the truth it points to is profound: the world will keep inventing new creatures, and if we linger too long in the shadows of the past, we risk being fossilized. The church’s calling is not to be a museum of relics but a living organism that can run, sprint, and sometimes even fly.

*Takeaway:* What would happen if you let your next ministry project be a “non‑dinosaur” experiment? Could the willingness to move quickly, to fail fast, and to learn together become the very testimony the world is waiting for? The answer might just be the next chapter of the gospel story we’re called to write.
