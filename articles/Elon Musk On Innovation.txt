**When Engineers Meet the Shop Floor: Lessons from SpaceX for the Church**

Last month I found myself in a cramped conference room at a midsized church that had just hired a new worship‑tech team. The air smelled faintly of coffee and fresh paint, and the whiteboard was already covered in arrows, sticky notes, and half‑drawn diagrams of a streaming setup. The team was eager, the budget was thin, and the timeline felt like a race against the calendar of Advent. As I listened to the lead‑technician describe how the worship team kept changing the lighting cues on the fly, I heard a familiar echo of a story I’d heard from Elon Musk about SpaceX: “Put the engineers and the production crew in the same building, so they can talk to each other every day.”

It’s a simple idea, but the impact is seismic. When the engineers at SpaceX sketch a new rocket nozzle, they don’t file a PDF and send it off to a distant manufacturing plant. They sit next to the welders, the machinists, the people who will actually turn that sketch into metal. If a design is too hard to build, the engineer can walk over, point to the drawing, and say, “Hey, let’s simplify that curve.” The redesign happens in minutes, not weeks. The feedback loop collapses from months to hours.

I thought about the worship‑tech team’s workflow. The worship leader would write a set‑list, hand it off to the tech crew, and then wait for the day of service to discover a missing cue or a mis‑aligned video file. The “design” of the service was already frozen before the “production” team could even weigh in. The result? Scrambles, stress, and a few missed moments that felt like small betrayals to the congregation.

What if we applied SpaceX’s tight feedback loop to ministry? Imagine the pastor and the worship‑tech lead sitting side‑by‑side during rehearsal, sketching out the flow of a service on a shared screen. The tech person could instantly point out that a 30‑second video will take too long to load on the streaming platform, prompting the pastor to either trim the clip or choose a lower‑resolution version. The worship team could suggest a lighting cue that would be impossible to achieve with the existing rig, and the tech lead could immediately propose a simpler, yet still beautiful, alternative. By co‑locating design and production, we reduce the “cost” of miscommunication—time, stress, and the worship experience itself.

The other piece Musk highlighted was incentives. SpaceX rewards teams that shave dollars off the bill of materials, not just those who meet a deadline. In a church, we often reward volunteers with thank‑you notes, coffee, maybe a gift card. Those are nice, but they don’t align with the goal of cost reduction or efficiency. What if we started recognizing those who identify a cheaper, sustainable solution for a lighting rig, or who streamline the livestream workflow so we can reach more people without buying new servers? A simple “Innovation of the Month” board could shift the culture from “getting the job done” to “getting the job done smarter.”

There’s also a theological angle. The Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “Do you not know that we are to share everything we have?” (1 Cor 10:25). Sharing resources isn’t just a charitable act; it’s a strategic one. When we design together, we’re stewarding what God has given us—time, talent, technology—more faithfully.

So I left that conference room with a notebook full of doodles: a side‑by‑side service planning board, a simple incentive chart, a reminder to keep the engineering and production crews literally in the same room (or at least on the same video call). The next Sunday, the worship‑tech team tried it. The result was a smoother service, a few less frantic moments, and a collective sigh of relief that felt almost like a prayer.

If we can let a rocket company’s practice reshape how we worship, imagine what else we could do when we bring the gospel into the very fabric of our creative processes. Maybe the next breakthrough isn’t a new app but a new way of collaborating that honors both the Creator and the created.

*Take a moment this week to sit down with the person who builds what you envision. Ask, “What could we simplify together?” and watch the cost of miscommunication melt away.*

**The Sacred Cost of Failure: Why Our Ministry Needs a Tolerance for Bold Mistakes**

A few weeks ago I was on a call with a group of seminary students who were wrestling with a semester‑long project: building a chatbot that could answer basic theological questions for college students. Their excitement was palpable, but so was their fear. “What if it says something wrong?” one asked. “What if the dean pulls the plug?” another whispered. I could hear the echo of a familiar refrain: “Innovation is great, but we can’t afford to fail.”

Elon Musk, talking about SpaceX, once said that an organization must “allow for failure” if it wants bold innovation. He warned that punishing people for missteps leads to incrementalism—tiny tweaks instead of leaps. The idea struck me like a bolt of lightning because, in ministry, we often treat failure as a sin, a sign of incompetence, or worse, a cause for dismissal.

I remembered the first time I tried to livestream a worship service from my living room. I’d set up a cheap webcam, a laptop, and a shaky tripod. The day of the service, my internet hiccuped, the audio cut out, and my toddler decided to make a cameo appearance, shouting “Jesus loves you!” right in the middle of a hymn. I was mortified. I wanted to shut down the stream, delete the recording, and never speak of it again. Instead, I posted a brief note apologizing for the technical glitches, thanked everyone for their patience, and promised to do better next time.

That little failure taught me a massive lesson: the congregation didn’t leave because of the glitch; they stayed because the message remained. The same principle applies to any bold ministry experiment. The cost of failure isn’t the mistake itself—it’s the missed opportunity to learn, to pivot, and to grow deeper in humility.

SpaceX’s model is instructive. When a prototype rocket exploded, the team didn’t bury the data or blame the engineers. They celebrated the fact that the vehicle “did something we never wanted it to do” and poured over the telemetry to understand why. That mindset turns a catastrophic loss into a data point, a stepping stone to the next successful launch.

In the church, we can adopt a similar posture. When a new discipleship app crashes, when a community garden fails to yield, when a sermon series falls flat, we can treat those moments as “data.” We ask, “What did we learn about our people, our context, our methods?” We then adjust, not retreat. It requires a cultural shift: moving from a “no‑mistake” environment to a “learning‑from‑mistake” one.

But there’s a theological anchor here, too. The Psalms remind us that God is a “refuge in times of trouble” (Psalm 46:1). He is not a deity who penalizes us for honest missteps; He is a Father who invites us into a relationship where we can be vulnerable. When we model that vulnerability to our congregations, we demonstrate a faith that is alive, not sterile.

In practice, this could mean setting up a simple “Innovation Review” after each project, where the focus is on insights, not blame. It could look like a quick Slack channel where anyone can post “What went wrong, and what did we learn?” without fear of retribution. It could be as simple as a prayer circle where we ask God for wisdom to see failures as opportunities for grace.

I’m still figuring out the right balance. Too much tolerance for failure can lead to recklessness; too little leads to stagnation. The key, I think, is a “risk‑reward” framework that rewards bold ideas while providing a safety net for inevitable missteps. SpaceX does this by tying compensation to cost reduction and innovation, not just to on‑time delivery. In ministry, we can tie recognition to the courage to try something new, regardless of the immediate outcome.

If we can learn to love our mistakes as a farmer loves a failed crop—because it tells him something about the soil, the seed, the weather—then we’ll be better equipped to cultivate the kingdom in ever‑more fertile ways.

*Next week, pick one “failed” project you’ve been nursing. Bring it to a trusted colleague, ask what it taught you, and thank God for the lesson hidden in the disappointment.*

**Opening the Door: What If Oil & Gas Leaders Saw Our Missional Tech Labs?**

When I watched Elon Musk field a question about whether oil‑and‑gas companies could tour SpaceX’s cost‑cutting facilities, I felt a tug of curiosity. He answered, “Within the bounds of what the US government will let us do, we’re happy to show people around.” The notion of opening a high‑tech, mission‑critical lab to outsiders—especially those from an industry often painted as the antithesis of stewardship—caught my imagination.

A few months ago, my church’s youth ministry decided to build a modest “media lab” in the basement. It was a repurposed storage room, a few laptops, a green screen, and a handful of volunteers who wanted to create videos for evangelism. We called it the “Missional Trail Studio” after the prototype game I’d been tinkering with on a plane ride. The aim was simple: give young people the tools to tell their stories, to reach beyond the walls of the sanctuary.

One Saturday, a local energy company’s community‑relations director knocked on our door. Their corporate social‑responsibility team wanted to partner on a “digital literacy” initiative for the surrounding neighborhood. My first instinct was to wonder: “Will they try to steer our content? Will they want us to paint oil in a better light?” The same question that probably ran through the minds of SpaceX engineers when a defense contractor asked for a tour.

Instead of shutting the door, I invited them in. We walked them through the tiny studio, showed them a montage of student‑made videos, and explained how each piece of equipment was chosen for cost‑effectiveness, not for flash. The director was genuinely surprised to see how much could be done with a refurbished camera and open‑source editing software. He asked, “How do you keep the costs down?” I answered, “We design for simplicity, we iterate fast, and we let the kids take the lead.”

What followed was a modest partnership: the energy company donated a set of LED lights (the kind they used in their own facilities) and funded a short‑term internship for a tech‑savvy teen to learn about renewable‑energy data visualization. In return, we produced a series of videos that explained how the community could reduce its carbon footprint, using the same language the company used in its annual sustainability report. The videos were shared on the church’s YouTube channel, on the company’s internal portal, and even on a local public‑access TV station.

The experience reminded me of Musk’s point: “There must be an expectation of innovation, and the compensation structure must reflect that.” In our case, the expectation was that both parties would bring something to the table—technology on one side, resources on the other. The compensation wasn’t a paycheck but a shared sense of purpose and a willingness to learn from each other’s playbooks.

There’s also a spiritual dimension. In Matthew 25:40, Jesus says, “Whatever you did for one of the least of these, you did for me.” By opening our modest lab to a corporate partner, we weren’t compromising our mission; we were extending the reach of that mission into a sphere that often feels distant from the church. We were saying, “We’re willing to sit at the same table, to listen, to co‑create, because the gospel is about reconciliation—not isolation.”

I’m not suggesting we hand over our ministries to the highest bidder or that we dilute our message for the sake of sponsorship. What I’m suggesting is a posture of openness, a willingness to let the “oil and gas” world see that the tools of innovation can be used for kingdom work. When SpaceX says it’s happy to show its processes to a competitor, it’s not about sharing trade secrets; it’s about modeling a culture where bold ideas are celebrated, not hoarded.

If you’re a pastor, a ministry leader, or a volunteer with a tech‑savvy heart, ask yourself: Who is knocking at my door? What could happen if I invited them in, not as a threat, but as a potential ally in the grand story of redemption? The answer may surprise you, and the collaboration could become a new chapter in how we tell the gospel in the digital age.

*Take a moment this week to identify one “outside” stakeholder—maybe a local business, a university, or even a skeptical friend. Invite them into your workspace, show them what you’re doing, and ask: “What can we learn from each other?”*
