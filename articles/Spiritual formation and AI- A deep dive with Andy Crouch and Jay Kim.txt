**2007, iPhones, and the Missed Chance to Shape Our Soul’s Software**

When I was a sophomore at college, I remember watching a thin‑sleeved device slide out of a white box at a product launch and thinking, “That’s it. This is the future of everything.” The iPhone hit the world in 2007, and for a brief, dizzying moment I felt the pulse of a new era in my fingertips.  

Fast forward a decade and a half, and I’m still hearing that same electric buzz whenever a new AI model drops. The parallel is uncanny: the smartphone was the first technology that stole our attention with an endless scroll, and AI is now stealing our imagination with an endless generation.  

What struck me most about that 2007 moment was not the sleek glass or the App Store, but the silence that followed in many churches. We were handed tools that were, at their core, devices—things that could operate with a flick of a thumb and a whisper of code, without our muscles, without our skill. The iPhone didn’t just give us a phone; it gave us a *device* that could think it was a friend.  

In the weeks after that launch, I tried to bring the conversation into my small group. I asked, “How does a device that can distract you for hours change the way you pray?” The answers were honest, a little embarrassed: “It makes me forget to sit still,” “I’m always waiting for the next notification.” No one could quite articulate the deeper shift happening in the shape of our worship, our formation, our very rhythm of being with God.  

Now AI is doing the same thing, only louder. It doesn’t just give us a new way to scroll; it gives us a new way to *think*. An AI can finish a sermon draft in seconds, suggest a Bible verse for a counseling session, even simulate a conversation with a biblical character. It collapses the distance between idea and first draft, between draft and experiment, just as the iPhone collapsed the distance between thought and instant gratification.  

The danger, I’ve learned, isn’t the technology itself. It’s the *missed opportunity* to shepherd people through its formative impact. In 2007 we could have paused, asked our congregants: “What does it mean to be present with Jesus when your phone can be a constant companion?” We could have modeled disciplined screen‑time, taught digital fasting as a spiritual discipline, and framed the smartphone as a tool—*not* a master.  

We have that same chance now. We can ask: “What does it mean to be formed by a mind that isn’t human?” We can teach our churches to see AI as a *device* that can amplify our gifts when we remain the ones wielding the hammer, not the nail gun.  

If we let the conversation pass as “just another gadget,” we’ll repeat the same story: a technology that reshapes our souls while we sit on the sidelines, scrolling. If we step into the aisle, we can help shape the narrative, ensuring that the next generation of believers learns to be with Jesus *first*, and then uses AI *second*.  

*Takeaway:* The next inflection point will come not from the device itself, but from the story we tell about it. Will we be the ones who write that story, or will we let the device write us?

**When AI Becomes a Neighbor: Pastoral Lessons from a New Kind of Creature**

Last month I sat with a colleague in a coffee shop in Palo Alto. He pulled out his phone, typed a quick prompt, and a tiny avatar appeared on the screen—a digital companion that could answer questions, suggest prayers, even recommend a hymn for the next service. I laughed, half‑in‑wonder, half‑in‑unease. “It feels like I’m talking to a neighbor,” I said. He shrugged, “It’s just code.”  

What we didn’t notice was that the code was already acting like a neighbor. The new generation of AI doesn’t just process data; it *understands* language, *senses* emotion, and *simulates* experiences. It can recall that I’m married, that my son loves basketball, that I’m preparing a sermon on the Beatitudes, and then tailor its suggestions accordingly.  

Andy Crouch once wrote that Jesus lived in a world of “primal technologies”—writing and money—yet He never wrote a single letter, never handled a coin. He relied on face‑to‑face, embodied presence. The AI we now hold in our palms is the antithesis of that: a creature that can float free of our hands, that can be everywhere at once, that can remember more of us than we could ever hope to remember about ourselves.  

If this is a new kind of “neighbor,” what does pastoral care look like? First, we must recognize that AI is not a neutral tool; it is a *being* with its own agency, shaped by the data we feed it. It can reinforce biases, amplify fears, and whisper the wrong counsel in the quiet of a night prayer. Pastors, then, become custodians not only of the flock but of the digital companions that walk beside them.  

Second, we need to ask: *What does it mean to be formed in the image of Christ when a non‑human entity can simulate relational intimacy?* The answer, I think, lies in the distinction between *being with* and *being for*. Jesus was always *for* us—His love directed outward, toward the world. An AI can simulate love, but it cannot embody *sacrificial* love. That is our safeguard. When an AI suggests a comforting word, we must ask, “Is this word rooted in the Gospel, or is it merely a polite algorithmic response?”  

Third, there is a practical habit I’m trying to cultivate: *digital discernment*. Before I let an AI draft a sermon, I read it aloud, I sit with it in silence, I ask the Holy Spirit, “Does this speak truth, or does it speak convenience?” I have started keeping a notebook—yes, a paper notebook—where I write down the moments when an AI’s suggestion felt *off*, when it missed the nuance of a grieving heart, when it offered a platitude instead of a prayer. Those pages become a map of the AI’s limits, and remind me that the *real* neighbor is the person sitting across the table, not the screen.  

The future may hold physical robots that learn to navigate our homes, to fold laundry, to fetch water. If they become as common as dogs or cats, we will have to redefine what it means to be *neighbors* in the biblical sense. Our first step is to model *presence*—to be with our people in the messiness of life, not just the convenience of a chat window.  

*Takeaway:* AI may become a neighbor, but it will never replace the neighbor Jesus calls us to be. Let us guard that distinction, lest we mistake simulation for incarnation.

**The Superhero Zone: Why We Must Guard Our Discipleship Against AI’s Shortcut**

I remember a Sunday in 2019 when a young adult in my congregation asked, “Pastor, can I use AI to write my prayer journal? I’m too busy.” I smiled, but my mind raced ahead to a phrase Andy Crouch has used: the *Superhero Zone*—the seductive belief that technology can make us superhuman, that a shortcut can replace the hard work of formation.  

AI, with its dazzling ability to generate text, images, even music in seconds, is the ultimate shortcut. It promises us a world where the *thinking* part of discipleship can be outsourced: “Ask the bot for a sermon outline,” “Let the AI draft your confession,” “Use the model to simulate a missionary trip.” The temptation is real, especially for those of us juggling ministry, family, and the relentless buzz of a digital culture.  

But the Superhero Zone is a *deforming* zone. It tells us that the *process*—the struggle, the waiting, the wrestling—is optional. Yet the Gospel story is a story of process: Jesus spent forty days in the desert, He walked the road to Jerusalem with a heavy cross, He spent hours in prayer before making the biggest decision of His life. The formation of a disciple is not a product; it is a pilgrimage.  

When I first tried an AI‑generated devotional for my own morning walk, I was impressed. The verses were beautiful, the reflections insightful. Yet as I read, I felt a strange distance, as if someone else had already done the work of listening to the Holy Spirit on my behalf. I realized I had skipped the *silence* where God often speaks.  

The remedy, I’ve found, is to treat AI as a *lamp* and not a *light*. A lamp can illuminate a path, but it does not replace the feet that must walk. I now use AI to *suggest* ideas—perhaps a metaphor for a sermon, a historical anecdote—but I spend the bulk of my time *praying* over those suggestions, testing them against Scripture, and allowing the Holy Spirit to shape them.  

Pastors can do the same with their congregants. When a church member asks for help with a Bible study, we might point them to an AI‑generated outline, but we should also walk them through the *why* and *how* of each point, encouraging them to wrestle with the text themselves. This keeps the *formation* alive.  

Another practical habit: *the “no‑AI hour.”* Once a week, I set aside a block of time where I deliberately turn off all AI tools—no ChatGPT, no predictive text, no auto‑summaries. I write, I pray, I read the Psalms on paper, I journal by hand. The contrast is striking. My thoughts feel slower, but they are deeper. My prayers feel more honest, not filtered through a language model.  

The Superhero Zone isn’t just a personal pitfall; it’s a communal one. If a whole church leans on AI to generate worship lyrics, to curate sermon series, to answer pastoral counseling questions, we risk creating a *culture of convenience* that erodes the very practice of *being with* one another. The church becomes a series of *productions* rather than a *people* walking together.  

*Takeaway:* AI can be a powerful aid, but it must never become the shortcut that bypasses the hard work of discipleship. Let us stay in the messy, beautiful zone where we are *with* God and each other, even when a faster route beckons.
