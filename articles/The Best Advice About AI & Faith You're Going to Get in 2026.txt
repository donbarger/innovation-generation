**Why I’m Not a Doomer (and Why You Might Not Need to Be Either)**

I’ve been chewing on a line from a recent panel at George Fox: “You can’t be a doomer and a person of faith.” It sounded like a paradox, but the more I let it sit, the more it began to make sense. When I first heard the book title *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies*—a grim reminder of the AGI apocalypse—my heart jumped. I imagined Skynet‑style robots marching down the streets of downtown DC, and I felt the familiar shiver of fear that so many tech‑savvy Christians have been feeling lately.  

Then Isaac, the philosopher‑theologian on the panel, leaned in and said something that stopped the panic in its tracks: “I’m not worried about Terminators. I’m worried about kids who grow up never learning to think for themselves because they hand every problem to a chatbot.” That struck a chord. The real danger, he argued, isn’t a sudden robot uprising; it’s a slow, quiet erosion of our cognitive muscles.  

I thought back to the first time I tried “vibe‑coding” a prototype on a plane. The thrill of seeing a working game appear at 38,000 feet was intoxicating, but it also reminded me how easy it is to lean on a tool to do the heavy lifting. The next time I’m tempted to let an AI write a sermon draft, I ask myself: am I outsourcing my thinking, or am I using the tool to sharpen it?  

Megan Sullivan, who sat beside me, added a theological lens: “When we cede power to developers, we hand them the reins of salvation.” She warned that fear‑mongering is a tactic that can make us feel powerless, driving us to cling to a single “savior”—whether that’s a tech guru or a political leader. The gospel, she reminded us, is not a safety net that catches us when we fall into the abyss of technology; it’s the rope that steadies us as we walk the tightrope.  

Tyler, the pastor from Bridgetown, offered the counter‑balance: “I’m not an alarmist. I see the world through the story of renewal—Christ will reign, and Babylon will fall.” He didn’t deny the risks; he simply placed them within a larger narrative of hope. That’s the sweet spot for me: acknowledging the danger without letting it dominate the conversation.  

So where does that leave us? Not in a bunker, not in a panic room, but in a workshop. We need to be intentional about the ways we integrate AI into our ministries, our classrooms, our homes. We need to ask the “how might we?” question before the “what if it destroys everything?” question.  

If you’re sitting with a notebook and a laptop, consider this: what would it look like if you used AI to amplify your God‑given gifts rather than replace them? What would it look like if you taught your kids to ask AI for a first draft, then spend the next hour polishing it with their own heart and mind?  

The future isn’t a binary of apocalypse or utopia. It’s a series of choices we make today. Choose the tools that stretch your imagination, not the ones that shrink your capacity to think.  

*Take a moment tonight to write down one place you’ve let AI do the thinking for you. What would it look like if you reclaimed that space?*

**The Silent Curriculum: How AI Is Shaping Our Kids’ Minds**  

I still remember the first time a 12‑year‑old asked me, “Can you teach me how to cheat on my math test with ChatGPT?” The question came over a Zoom call with my nephew, who was half‑laughing, half‑serious. My first instinct was to panic—what does this say about the generation growing up with a conversational AI at their fingertips?  

Later that week, I listened to Isaac Choi on the George Fox panel. He didn’t talk about killer robots; he talked about the “cognitive handicap” of a generation that could outsource every problem to a language model. He painted a picture of children who never wrestle with the frustration of a failed proof, who never experience the quiet joy of stumbling on a solution after hours of scribbled attempts.  

That image has haunted me. When I was a kid, I learned to read by holding a book in my hands, feeling the weight of the pages, turning them slowly, letting the words sink in. When I was a teen, I learned math by staring at a chalkboard, making mistakes, and then correcting them. Those tactile, messy processes built something more than knowledge—they forged perseverance, humility, and a sense of wonder at the mystery of learning itself.  

Now, AI can hand you an answer in seconds. It can draft a sermon, write a poem, solve a differential equation, all before you’ve had a chance to ask “why?” That speed is intoxicating, especially for busy pastors and over‑committed parents. But it also creates a silent curriculum—a set of habits we’re not teaching, yet are being taught.  

Megan Sullivan warned that the tech industry’s promise often comes wrapped in fear: “When developers control the narrative, they wield spiritual power.” She reminded us that the gospel calls us to discern, not just to consume. Tyler added a practical note: “If you can trust a 16‑year‑old with a two‑ton assembly of metal and glass, you can trust them with a tiny piece of tech. But you have to teach them how to use it wisely.”  

I’ve started a small experiment in my own home. Whenever my kids ask for help on a homework problem, I let them type the question into an AI, but I require them to write down the AI’s answer, then spend ten minutes explaining it in their own words. The result? They still get the correct solution, but they also learn to translate the machine’s language into something personal. It’s a tiny rebellion against the instant‑gratification model, and it feels like a seed of resistance.  

The real danger isn’t that AI will replace teachers; it’s that it will replace the *process* of thinking. If we let that happen, we risk raising a generation that can quote the Bible verbatim but can’t wrestle with its paradoxes.  

So I ask you, fellow shepherds of the next generation: what habits are you modeling around AI? Are you letting it be a crutch, or a catalyst?  

*Tonight, watch a child (or a student) grapple with a problem without reaching for the AI. Notice the frustration, the sighs, the eventual grin. That is where true learning lives.*

**Babylon, AI, and the Hope of the New Jerusalem**  

When I heard Tyler speak about Babylon falling, my mind raced back to the ancient ruins of Rome that my grandparents visited on a summer road trip. The crumbling arches, the moss‑covered columns, the silent streets—each stone whispered a story of empire, pride, and eventual collapse. Tyler linked that narrative to our modern “Babylon”: the massive, ever‑expanding tech empire that shapes how we live, work, and worship.  

He didn’t say we should celebrate its downfall—he said, “When Babylon falls, the poor rejoice because the Lamb’s judgment has come.” It’s a sobering reminder that every empire, no matter how powerful, is temporary. And yet, in the same breath, he affirmed a hope that never wavers: the New Jerusalem, where Christ reigns.  

The panel’s conversation about AI was a modern echo of that ancient tension. On one side, we have the promise of AI—precision medicine, climate modeling, tools that can amplify our ministries. On the other, we have the specter of a “superintelligence” that could outpace human control, a scenario the author of *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies* warns about.  

Isaac’s probabilistic estimate—5 % chance of true AGI in our lifetimes—felt oddly biblical. The Bible is full of numbers that remind us of our limited understanding: “the days of Noah were 120 years” (Genesis 6:3), “the number of the beast is 666.” These are not predictions but signposts urging vigilance.  

Megan reminded us that fear can be weaponized: “When developers say ‘be terrified,’ they’re shifting power to themselves.” That’s why the gospel calls us to “be strong and courageous” (Joshua 1:9) not because the world is safe, but because our hope is anchored in something unshakable.  

I find myself returning to a simple practice: before I dive into a new AI tool, I pause, pray, and ask, “What kingdom purpose does this serve? What does it reveal about the world I’m entering?” It’s a tiny litmus test, but it keeps my heart from being swept away by the tide of novelty.  

We are living in a moment when the “digital Babylon” is both a source of oppression (surveillance, data exploitation) and a platform for liberation (global discipleship, access to Scripture). The paradox is real, but so is the promise that God can redeem any system. In Revelation, the fall of Babylon is followed not by desolation but by the arrival of a new city, bright as a bride.  

So, as we navigate AI, let us keep two eyes on the horizon: one on the present, where we steward technology wisely; the other on the future, where Christ’s reign will render all empires obsolete.  

*Take a breath. Write down one way you can use AI today that points people toward the hope of the New Jerusalem, not away from it.*
