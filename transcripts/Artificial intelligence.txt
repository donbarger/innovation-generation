Artificial intelligence
(
AI
) is the capability of
computational systems
to perform tasks typically associated with
human intelligence
, such as
learning
,
reasoning
,
problem-solving
,
perception
, and
decision-making
. It is a
field of research
in
computer science
that develops and studies methods and
software
that enable machines to perceive their environment and use
learning
and
intelligence
to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
[

]
High-profile
applications of AI
include advanced
web search engines
(e.g.,
Google Search
);
recommendation systems
(used by
YouTube
,
Amazon
, and
Netflix
);
virtual assistants
(e.g.,
Google Assistant
,
Siri
, and
Alexa
);
autonomous vehicles
(e.g.,
Waymo
);
generative
and
creative
tools (e.g.,
language models
and
AI art
); and
superhuman
play and analysis in
strategy games
(e.g.,
chess
and
Go
). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's
not labeled AI anymore
."

Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning,
reasoning
,
knowledge representation
,
planning
,
natural language processing
,
perception
, and support for
robotics
.
[
a
]
To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including
search
and
mathematical optimization
,
formal logic
,
artificial neural networks
, and methods based on
statistics
,
operations research
, and
economics
.
[

AI also draws upon
psychology
,
linguistics
,
philosophy
,
neuroscience
, and other fields.
[

]
Some companies, such as
OpenAI
,
Google DeepMind
and
Meta
,
[

]
aim to create
artificial general intelligence
(AGI) – AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,
[
6
]
and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout
its history
,
[
7
]
[
8
]
followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as
AI winters
.
[
9
]
[
10
]
Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when
graphics processing units
started being used to accelerate neural networks, and
deep learning
outperformed previous AI techniques.
[
11
]
This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the
transformer architecture
.
[
12
]
In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid
progress
in advanced generative AI became known as the
AI boom
. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several
unintended consequences and harms
.
Ethical concerns
have been raised about
AI's long-term effects
and
potential existential risks
, prompting discussions about
regulatory policies
to ensure
the safety
and benefits of the technology.
