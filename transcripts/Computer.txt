From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This is an IBM System/360.
A
computer
is a
machine
that uses
electronics
to input, process, store, and output
data
. Data is information such as numbers, words, and lists. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a
hard drive
, or a
sensor
. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in
software
programs. A computer program is a list of instructions the computer has to perform. Programs usually perform mathematical calculations, modify data, or move it around. The data is then saved on a storage device, shown on a
display
, or sent to another computer. Computers can be connected together to form a
network
such as the
internet
, allowing the computers to communicate with each other.
The
processor
of a computer is made from
integrated circuits
(chips) that contains many
transistors
. Most computers are
digital
, which means that they represent information using
binary
digits
, or
bits
. Computers come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the brand, model, and purpose. They range from small computers, such as smartphones and
laptops
, to large computers, such as
supercomputers
.
Characteristics
[
change
|
change source
]
Two things that often define a computer are that it responds to a specific
instruction set
in a well-defined manner, and that it can execute a stored list of instructions called a
program
. There are four main actions in a computer:
inputting
,
storing
,
outputting
and processing.
Modern computers can do billions of calculations in a second. Being able to calculate many times per second allows modern computers to multi-task, which means they can do many different tasks at the same time. Computers do many different jobs where
automation
is useful. Some examples are controlling
traffic lights
, vehicles, security systems,
washing machines
and digital televisions.
Computers can be designed to do almost anything with certain information.  Computers are used to control large and small machines that, in the past, were controlled by humans. Billions of people have a
personal computer
at home or at work. They are used for things such as calculation, listening to music, reading, writing, or playing
games
.
Hardware
[
change
|
change source
]
Modern computers are electronic
computer hardware
. They do mathematical
arithmetic
very quickly, but computers do not really "think." They only follow the instructions in their software programs. The
software
uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions and produces useful outputs.
Controls
[
change
|
change source
]
Computers are controlled with
user interfaces
.
Input devices
which include
keyboards
,
computer mice
, buttons, and
touch screens
, etc.computer are electronic computer hardware.
Programs
[
change
|
change source
]
Computer programs
are designed or written by
computer programmers
. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language, called
machine code
. Most programs are written using a
programming language
like:
C
,
Fortran
,
JavaScript
,
Lisp
, and
Pascal
. These programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day. The
compiler
converts the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) that the computer will understand and do what is needed.
History of computers
[

The
Jacquard loom
was one of the first programmable devices.
First computer
[
change
|
change source
]
In 1837,
Charles Babbage
proposed the first general mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine contained an Arithmetic
Logic
Unit, basic flow control,
punched cards
, and integrated memory. It is the first general-purpose computer concept that could be used for many things and not only one particular program. However, this computer was never built while Charles Babbage was alive, because he didn't have enough money. In 1910, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage's youngest son, was able to finish a part of this machine and do basic calculations.
Main article:
Computer programming
Before the computer era there were machines that could do the same thing over and over again, like a music box. People began to want to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. This part of computer history is called the "history of programmable machines", which in simple words means "the history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language."
One of the first examples of programmable machines was built by
Hero of Alexandria
(c. 10–70
AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10
minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.
[

]
Some people disagree on which early computer is programmable. Many say the "castle clock", an
astronomical clock
invented by
Al-Jazari
in 1206, is the first known
programmable
analog computer
.

The length of
day
and
night
could be adjusted every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year.

Some count this daily adjustment as computer programming.
Others say the first computer was made by
Charles Babbage

The computing era
[
change
|
change source
]
At the end of the
Middle Ages
, people started thinking math and
engineering
were more important. In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical
calculator
. Other Europeans made more calculators after him. They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play
Tetris
. Because of this, we say they were not programmable. Now engineers use computers to design and plan.
In 1801,
Joseph Marie Jacquard
used
punched paper cards
to tell his
textile loom
what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted. This means the loom was programmable. At the end of the 1800s Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine, developing punched card data processing
technology
for the 1890 U.S. census. His tabulating machines read and summarized data stored on punched cards and they began use for government and commercial data processing.
Charles Babbage
wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate. He called it "The Analytical Engine".
[
8
]
Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.
As time went on, computers were used more. People get bored easily doing the same thing over and over. Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again. The
U.S. Census Bureau
in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that. It was expensive, and reports took a long time. Then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work.
Herman Hollerith
invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation (which later became
IBM
) made his machines. They
leased
the machines instead of selling them. Makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them, and CTR's tech support was especially good.
Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.
Analog and digital computers
[
change
|
change source
]
In the first half of the
20th century
,
scientists
started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together. For example, if they had to launch a
rocket ship
, they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right. So they put together computers. These
analog computers
used
analog
circuits, which made them very hard to program. In the
1930s
, they invented
digital
computers, and soon made them easier to program. However this is not the case as many consecutive attempts have been made to bring arithmetic logic to l3.Analog computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems.Some are used to control machines as well.
High-scale computers
[
change
|
change source
]
Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the
1930s
to
1940s
. Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them. Here are a few of the computers they built:

's
electromechanical
"Z machines". The
Z3
(1941) was the first working machine that used
binary
arithmetic. Binary arithmetic means using "Yes" and "No." to add numbers together. You could also program it. In
1998
the Z3 was proved to be
Turing complete
. Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer. It is the world's first modern computer.
The non-programmable
Atanasoff–Berry Computer
(1941) which used vacuum tubes to store "yes" and "no" answers, and
regenerative capacitor memory
.
The
Harvard Mark I
(1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.
The U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory
ENIAC
(1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose
electronic
computer (since
Konrad Zuse
's
Z3
of 1941 used
electromagnets
instead of
electronics
). At first, however, the only way to reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.
Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as "stored program architecture" or
von Neumann architecture
.
John von Neumann
talked about this design in the paper
First Draft of a Report on the
EDVAC
, distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time. The first of these was completed in
Great Britain
. The first to be demonstrated working was the
Manchester
Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or "Baby"), while the
EDSAC
, completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—
EDVAC
—was completed but was not ready for two years.
Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture. It has become the main
concept
which defines a modern computer. The technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.
Microprocessors
are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program
CPUs
.
In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly
vacuum tubes
.
Transistors
replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper. They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on
integrated circuits
.
Microprocessors
, such as the
Intel 4004
made computers smaller, cheaper, faster and more reliable. By the 1980s,
microcontrollers
became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like
washing machines
. The 1980s also saw
home computers
and
personal computers
. With the evolution of the
Internet
, personal computers are becoming as common as the
television
and the
telephone
in the household.
In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) "
multimedia
computers" and after the launch of the Apple
iPhone
in 2007, many are now starting to add the
smartphone
category among "real" computers. In 2008, if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, was no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather
Nokia
.

Kinds of computers
[
change

change source
]
There are many types of computers. Some include:
Personal computer
Workstation
Mainframe
Minicomputer
Supercomputer
Embedded system
Tablet computer
Quantum computer
A "desktop computer" is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer). Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called "desktop computers." "
Laptop
computers" are computers small enough to fit on your lap. This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games.
There are larger computers that can be used by multiple people at the same time. These are called "mainframes," and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this: the personal computer is like your skin: you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world. A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.
An embedded computer, also called an
embedded system
is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well. For example, an
alarm clock
is an embedded computer. It tells the time. Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris. Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed because you cannot install more programs on your clock. Some
mobile phones
,
automatic teller machines
,
microwave ovens
,
CD players
and
cars
are operated by embedded computers.
All-in-one PC
[
change
|
change source
]
All-in-one computers are
desktop computers
that have all of the computer's inner mechanisms in the same case as the
monitor
.
Apple
has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the
original Macintosh
of the mid-1980s and the
iMac
of the late 1990s and 2000s.

Computers store data and the instructions as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as
binary
symbols
(1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a
bit
, which comes from the words binary
digit
. Computers can use many bits together to represent
instructions
and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a
program
and is stored on the computer's
hard disk
. Computers work through the program by using a
central processing unit
, and they use fast memory called
RAM
(also known as Random Access Memory) as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the
hard disk
because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.
An
operating system
tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. Millions of computers may be using the same
operating system
, while each computer can have its own
application programs
to do what its user needs. Using the same
operating systems
makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. A user who needs to use a computer for something different, can learn how to use a new application program. Some
operating systems
can have simple command lines or a fully user-friendly
GUI
.
The Internet
[
change
|
change source
]
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with
communication
. Communication is how people share
information
. Computers have helped people move forward in
science
,
medicine
,
business
, and
learning
, because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other people communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The
Internet
is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers. The Internet also allows the computer user to play an
Online game
.
Computers and waste
[
change
|
change source
]
A computer is now almost always an
electronic device
. It usually contains materials that will become
electronic waste
when discarded. When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its
waste management
must also be paid for. This is called
product stewardship
.
Computers can become
obsolete
quickly, depending on what programs the user runs. Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because some newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so
computer recycling
happens a lot. Many projects try to send working computers to
developing nations
so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as
hard drives
, can break easily. When these parts end up in the
landfill
, they can put
poisonous
chemicals like
lead
into the ground-water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like
credit card
numbers. If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an
identity thief
can get the information from the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it, for example, to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.
Main hardware
[
change
|
change source
]
Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
All computers have a
CPU
.
All computers have some kind of
data bus
which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.
All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips (
integrated circuits
) which can hold information.
Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.
Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other
peripheral devices
connected.
A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a
human body
, the
CPU
is like a brain. It does most of the thinking and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the
Motherboard
, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the
nerves
that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides
electricity
to the entire computer. The various drives (
CD
drive,
floppy drive
, and on many newer computers,
USB flash drive
) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The
hard drive
is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a
sound card
or another method of making sound, which is like
vocal cords
, or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are
speakers
, which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a
graphics card
, which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as
3D
environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.
