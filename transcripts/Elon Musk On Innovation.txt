Title: Elon Musk On Innovation

Give them. How does one go about really reducing the costs of a venture? Well, you have to innovate, you have to do different things and there has to be a tight feedback loop on innovation. And one of the things I think is advantageous for the way that SpaceX operates is that the engineering team and the production team are in the same facility and there is good communication back and forth. So as the engineers see that they've designed something that is difficult to manufacture, they can adjust their design quickly to make it easier to build. And the pace at which we're able to do new versions of the rocket is also much faster. So innovation, just improving things is key. But that actually sounds lovely and everyone talks a lot about innovation. There must be an expectation. What can people take away from? There has to be an expectation, establish an expectation of innovation and the compensation structure must reflect that. Uh huh. So you're basically incentivizing innovation and cost reduction. You have to. Incentive. Yes. Do you have to do the Henry Ford thing, which is every year you just expect the price to come down and the cost to come down. And that's just a kind of directive from above. So there needs to be an expectation of innovation. The compensation structure must reflect that. There must also be an allowance for failure because if you are trying something new necessarily there's some chance it will not work. So if you punish people too much for failure, then they will respond accordingly and the innovation you will get will be very incrementalist. Nobody's going to try anything bold for fear of getting fired or being punished in some way. So there must be. The risk reward must be balanced and favor taking bold moves, otherwise it will not happen. So is your door open to members of the oil and gas industry to come and see what you've done to really engineer costs out of. Out of SpaceX? Yeah, I mean there's some limitations of SpaceX because it's considered an advanced weapons technology, but. But within the bounds of what the US government will let us do, we're more than happy to show people around.
