Title: Brace Yourself for the AI Bubble
Video ID: L4bdfyu6Jnw

The AI bubble is about to burst. This is what many in Silicon Valley are saying, maybe true, maybe not. But here's what is true. Last year, $650 billion went into AI and 1.1 million jobs disappeared at the same time. I've seen cycles like this before.com, real estate, crypto, and I get to sit in boardrooms deciding which AI projects get millions in funding and which jobs are going to be at st. The story is always the same. The smart ones, you know, the top 1%, position themselves early and win whether the crash comes or not, while the rest suffer. So in this video, I want to share that exact playbook so you can stay ahead, become harder to replace, and future proof your career before it's too late. The first thing you need to understand, you have less time than you think. Imagine standing on a beach. The ocean suddenly pulls back. You look down at your ankles and think, well, I'm dry. Looks perfectly safe. But a thousand miles away, sensors show a wall of water racing towards shore at 500 miles an hour. That's what happens in every single tsunami. And that receding water moment is exactly where we are with AI right now. Shane Legg, co founder of Google's DeepMind, puts it very bluntly. He says, if your 100% done on a laptop, you're competing with AI that costs pennies. As this AI tsunami reaches us, it will create two zones for all of us. The high ground, where the 1% will survive and capture millions in wealth and success, and the flood zone, where perhaps 99% of the people will end up standing. Which brings us to the second thing you need to know how to recognize if you are standing in the flood zone right now. I was in a meeting watching an AI product demo last month. Beautifully designed, lighting, fast responses, cutting edge AI at the back end. But when I asked how many customers use this daily silence, the response was, well, we're not ready for primetime yet, but we're working on that right now. And I nodded, I smiled, said nothing but the translation. A million dollar science project. And that's the flood zone reality. Great demos, zero customers, zero cash. So how do you know if your company is in the flood zone? You can apply a framework I call rail R A I L. Just four questions takes about 50 seconds. R is revenue. Is your AI used by real paying customers? And if the answer is, well, we're still piloting or eventually we'll get there, that's a red flag. If you are leading a project with no clear revenue path, you're Going to be the first one on the chopping block. No revenue, no boat. A is acceleration. Can you deliver something real to customers in two weeks? Because if you can't, somebody else will for sure. So figure out where the friction is and how can AI remove it. This is your efficiency play. If you can't show real improvement in speed and efficiency from AI, it's a flood zone I stands for in market. So it's possible that you might be working on an internal tool. Now, that's not going to generate cash directly, but that's fine. But is it in the hands of your real users? Is it gathering real data? If it's just sitting on a shelf in a test environment, it's not a business asset, it's a hobby. And finally, L is learning. Are you learning from real customer use? This fourth one is a deal breaker because one week of watching customers break your product teaches you more than six months of internal testing. Also, the pace of AI is so feverish right now that if you are not constantly learning, you are already losing. And I've spoken about companies like Cursor before. They are an AI based product that helps you write code and they refine their product on a daily basis, launching a new feature every single day. That is the velocity of innovation that we all have to get used to. I'm still getting used to it. If your answer is no to at least two out of those four questions, the company you are building or working for might be in the flood zone. We have to ask the most important question, right? How do you get out of the flood zone? How do you get to the high ground? You get there with the right map. The map that 99% of the people will never see. The AI world today looks so confusing and chaotic from the outside. Orchestration layer, vector databases, tensor chips, things that didn't exist 10 years ago. But here's what you should do. Ignore all that noise. All you need is a simple map that shows you the three layers where the money is made. Layer number one, infrastructure. And this is where the fabs and chip makers and cloud and energy providers live. This is a game of massive capital. Unless you're Nvidia or have sovereign fund backing, it's hard to win here. Layer two is the Frontier models. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Xai and all the tooling companies around those models. This layer is consolidating really fast. Everyone's copying each other's features. Price per token has dropped by 98% in 18 months. And also open source models are closing the gap they're 80% as good, but way cheaper. So think about it. You wouldn't start an Internet search company today, would you? Why start a me too model company? Makes no sense. Now think about the dot com era. Remember the companies that laid fiber optic cables? Most of them went bankrupt. The ones who build apps on top of them like Amazon, YouTube, PayPal, they won. And that brings us to layer three, which is about apps and services. This is the interface, the solution. This layer is where the value is captured. If you're starting something on your own, this is where you should focus. Now there are three ways to think about this layer. Horizontal AI apps, vertical AI apps, and AI services. Horizontal AI apps work for everyone. So think of apps like Gamma for Presentation or Perplexity for AI based search. Huge market, but it's a distribution battle. You need millions of users to become profitable. Vertical apps, on the other hand, go deep. Think like Cursor for developers or Open Evidence for medicine. Smaller market, but you own your niche. And finally, AI services, and they're the implementation layer. Companies like Scale AI has proven that Humans in the Loop is a massive business opportunity because they handle the messy data work that models can't do. Yet the second big services opportunity here is integration. And I know boutique firms right now that charge $50,000 a month to help traditional companies plug AI into their workflows. They're not building software, they're just implementing it. They're the experts who charge you to set it up. So that's the map. Layer one and two are where the giants are fighting. Layer three is where you can build something amazing. Here's what most people miss. Knowing the map isn't enough, right? You need to know how to avoid the potholes when you're moving to the high ground. That's why number four is about avoiding the potholes. When you get to the high ground, the job apocalypse from AI may be inevitable. But it's not here yet. Sure, hiring has slowed down, but companies are still hiring at a slower pace. And the companies that are laying off people first are also the earliest adopters of AI. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, others. And they're cutting non AI roles to fund AI talent. So in this world, if your job is to maintain the status quo, you are unfortunately in the flood zone. So to get to the high ground, you have to move. AI will automate the scripted parts of any job. Your survival depends on owning the strategic parts. It doesn't matter if you're a software engineer or a consultant or a data annotator or accountant. Or analyst. The pattern is going to be the same. Script at work gets automated. Strategic judgment stays human. Here's your three step action plan. First step, audit your job. How much of your day is scripted versus strategic? Scripted work is like the mind numbing repetitive activities. Processing data, summarizing meetings, drafting standard internal emails, writing boilerplate code, whatever. Strategic work is about solving problems no one has seen before. Building client relationships, designing system architecture, catching edge cases that AI sometimes misses. So audit your work and divide it into these two categories, scripted and strategic. Step number two, fire yourself from the scripted parts. Automate all of it before your boss does it for you. And step number three, reinvest that time in developing your human edge on the strategic side. Now, this sounds counterintuitive somehow, but I work less on execution now and more on daydreaming. I actively disconnect, stare out the window, take long walks. And from the outside it may not look like work at all. But this is deep work. Because deep thinking requires silence. Not scrolling requires imagination, not information. That is where you can connect the dots that others cannot see. Cultivating these right habits alone won't save you. Not without the right mindset. The final framework you should know is the three R's you know. The top 1% who'll make it to the high ground will all share three things in common. The three Rs Rigor, Rig Relationship and Resilience. There are hundreds of AI startups in healthcare. They have come and gone. But Open evidence is worth $3.5 billion right now and it's used by 40% of US doctors daily. Why? Rigor. They fine tune their AI with such meticulous peer reviewed research and human feedback. Doctors just love them. They evaluated every edge case that would break most other startups. They understood their domain and the rigor it takes to succeed in it. And the data backs this up. BCG and Harvard ran a study with consultants using GPT4. Those with a deep understanding of their domain got 40% better results. Those without, only 12%. So that's the first thing you need to stay on high ground. Rigor, Deep understanding of your domain, your process, your data. Not surface level knowledge, but deep mastery of what you do. Second are relationships. I learned this simple truth while working at a company in New York about a decade ago. It was long hours, brutal pace. So I was there till late night most of the time. And I would always keep my office door open in the evening. My colleagues would stop by and we would have a chat. One of my colleagues would often stop by and we would talk for a while about lots of things. About his career, his fears, what he really wanted to do. And years later, he became the CEO of a $150 million company. And he told me that those conversations changed his mindset and trajectory. Not because I said something profound I didn't, but because someone actually was listening. He felt seen, and we were able to build a strong relationship. Every major move in my career, Wall street, tech, CEO role, board seats, happened because of my relationships, not my resume. In a world where AI can generate anything, you have to generate trust. And the final R is resilience. If you think about the stories that inspire us, there is always a pattern. Steve Jobs, fired from the company he founded, came back 12 years later and saved it. Shahrukh Khan, a long series of flops. Then he comes back and becomes the king of Bollywood again. Mandela, 27 years in prison and emerging to become the president of South Africa. We all love the comeback stories, the ones who fail but still endure. Pivoting, adapting, surviving, staying in the game long after everyone else has quit. Resilience and adaptability are etched in our human DNA. When I was young and going through massive challenges in my life, my teacher told me a short story. He said, imagine a small wave racing toward the shore. The wave sees the rocks and starts panicking. It screams into the ocean, why aren't you afraid? Look ahead. We're going to crash. It's over. And the ocean looks back and smiles and says, you still don't understand, do you? And says, you think you're a wave? You're water. You are the ocean. Most external things in our lives are waves. Titles, roles, markets, technologies. They rise, they fall. But your rigor, your relationships, your resilience, that's the water. The form changes, the substance remains the same. Let the tsunami come and the waves will crash. In the long run, you'll survive and thrive. So I hope that you go find your high ground. There's still time.
