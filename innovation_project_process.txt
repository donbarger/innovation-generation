Innovation Project Process

Purpose
-------
Document the end-to-end workflow for turning a YouTube presentation (or its transcript) into a Substack-ready innovation article written in Don Barger's voice.

Inputs
------
- Source material: YouTube video URL or a full transcript saved as `presentation_transcript.txt`.
- Metadata: video title, speaker name, date, URL (optional but helpful).

Process Overview
----------------
1. Ingest
   - Confirm the transcript file `presentation_transcript.txt` exists and contains the full, unedited transcript.
   - Save raw audio or video link in project notes for reference.

2. Internal Analysis (private, not output)
   - Read the entire transcript carefully.
   - Identify the speaker's main argument, the problem they address, and key assumptions.
   - Note any cultural, technological, or theological angles that naturally arise.
   - Ask: "What does a thoughtful Christian, missionary-technologist reader care about here?"

3. Drafting
   - Follow the `innovation_generation_guidelines.txt` voice and style rules.
   - Structure the article: Title → Hook opening (human moment) → Reflection → Insight section → (Optional) Christian reflection → Closing with practical takeaway.
   - Target length: 1,100–1,600 words.
   - Use short, sparing quotes from the transcript to illuminate points; never paste long sections.

4. Self-Review
   - Ensure the piece reads like Don thinking aloud: warm, curious, strategically minded, not preachy.
   - Check for forbidden patterns: no summary sections, no bullet lists in the final article, no heavy theological jargon, and no forced faith connections.
   - Confirm quotes are integrated and attributed cleanly when used.

5. Finalize
   - Produce a single file containing only the polished article text (ready to copy into Substack).
   - Name or save the file according to your local publishing workflow (e.g., `article_<slug>.txt`).

Quality Checklist
-----------------
- Voice: Personal, warm, occasionally self-deprecating, reflective but practical.
- Structure: Opens with a human moment; ends with a reflective, actionable takeaway.
- Sources: Transcript quoted sparingly and integrated into narrative.
- Length: Within target range.
- Output: Final file contains only the article — no notes, analysis, or meta commentary.

Roles & Responsibilities
-----------------------
- Author (Don): final editorial sign-off, tone calibration.
- Assistant (writing tool): performs analysis privately and drafts articles per guidelines.

Files & Links
-------------
- Primary transcript: `presentation_transcript.txt`
- Guidelines reference: `innovation_generation_guidelines.txt`

Next Steps
----------
